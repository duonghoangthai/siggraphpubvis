Our project aims to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What papers are influential in the field, in terms of citation count?
    \item Given a paper of interest, what papers does it cite? What are the papers citing it?
    \item What topics and techniques are popular, and in which time periods?
    \item Given a set of keywords, what are the most relevant papers/authors/institutions to these keywords?
    \item Who does each author collaborate with the most?
    \item What institutions are more active in a given field, in terms of publication count?    
\end{itemize}
Answering the above questions will put a make a researcher more informed about what papers/authors/topics/techniques to pay more attention to, thereby saving time in the beginning of a survey task. It can also reveal interesting patterns and trends in the past that can help him or her better decide on future research directions for a particular topic of interest.
