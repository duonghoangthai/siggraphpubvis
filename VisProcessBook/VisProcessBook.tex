\section{Project Progress - Milestone 1}
In this section we detail the progress of the project at the point of the milestone (13 November 2015). At this stage, we have devised and tested a working plan for data acquisition and processing, and have almost done executing this plan to obtain all the necessary data. We have also implemented a working prototype for the paper view where we show all the papers and the user can select a year and a paper to see its referenced papers and papers citing it.
