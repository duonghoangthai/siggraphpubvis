        "abstract": "Geometric transformations are most commonly represented as square matrices in computer graphics. Following simple geometric arguments we derive a natural and geometrically meaningful definition of scalar multiples and a commutative addition of transformations based on the matrix representation, given that the matrices have no negative real eigenvalues. Together, these operations allow the linear combination of transformations. This provides the ability to create weighted combination of transformations, interpolate between transformations, and to construct or use arbitrary transformations in a structure similar to a basis of a vector space. These basic techniques are useful for synthesis and analysis of motions or animations. Animations through a set of key transformations are generated using standard techniques such as subdivision curves. For analysis and progressive compression a PCA can be applied to sequences of transformations. We describe an implementation of the techniques that enables an easy-to-use and transparent way of dealing with geometric transformations in graphics software. We compare and relate our approach to other techniques such as matrix decomposition and quaternion interpolation. ",

The detail deformations are represented as displacements from this surface, and holes are filled smoothly within the displacement maps.

First, the original (arbitrary genus) mesh is substituted by a series of 2D maps in parameter space. Using these maps, our algorithm is then able to take advantage of established signal processing and halftoning tools that offer real-time interaction and intricate control. The user can easily combine these maps to create a control map  a map which controls the sampling density over the surface patch. This map is then sampled at interactive rates allowing the user to easily design a tailored re-sampling. Once this sampling is complete, a Delaunay triangulation and fast optimization are performed to perfect the final mesh. As a result, our remeshing technique is extremely versatile and general, being able to produce arbitrarily complex meshes with a variety of properties including: uniformity, regularity, semi-regularity, curvature sensitive resampling, and feature preservation. We provide a high level of control over the sampling distribution allowing the user to interactively custom design the mesh based on their requirements thereby increasing their productivity in creating a wide variety of meshes.",

OBIE gives the user direct, local control over object shape, size, and placement while dramatically reducing the time required to perform image editing tasks. Object selection is performed by manually collecting (subobject) regions detected by a watershed algorithm. Objects are tessellated into a triangular mesh, allowing shape modification to be performed in real time using OpenGL's texture mapping hardware. Through the use of anchor points, the user is able to interactively perform editing operations on a whole object, or just part(s) of an object - including moving, scaling, rotating, stretching, bending, and deleting. Indirect manipulation of object shape is also provided through the use of sliders and Bezier curves. Holes created by movement are filled in real-time based on surrounding texture. When objects stretch or scale, we provide a method for preserving texture granularity or scale.

Significant improvements in both the stability and realism were made possible by overcoming the post-buckling instability as well as the numerical instability. The instability caused by buckling arises from a structural instability and therefore cannot be avoided by simply employing a semi-implicit method. Addition of a damping force may help to avoid instabilities; however, it can significantly degrade the realism of the cloth motion. The method presented here uses a particlebased physical model to handle the instability in the post-buckling response without introducing any fictitious damping. ",

This is especially true of models which carry no natural parameterizations, such as subdivision surfaces or models acquired from 3D scanners. Instead, we remove the 2D parameterization and store the texture in 3D space as a sparse, adaptive octree. Because no parameterization is necessary, textures can be painted on any surface that can be rendered. No mappings between disparate topologies are used, so texture artifacts such as seams and stretching do not exist.

The second pass uses a rapid hierarchical integration technique to evaluate a diffusion approximation based on the irradiance samples. This approach is substantially faster than previous methods for rendering translucent materials, and it has the advantage that it integrates seamlessly with both scanline rendering and global illumination methods.

One appealing approach to obtaining a rich set of avatar behaviors is to collect an extended, unlabeled sequence of motion data appropriate to the application. In this paper, we show that such a motion database can be preprocessed for flexibility in behavior and efficient search and exploited for real-time avatar control. Flexibility is created by identifying plausible transitions between motion segments, and efficient search through the resulting graph structure is obtained through clustering. Three interface techniques are demonstrated for controlling avatar motion using this data structure: the user selects from a set of available choices, sketches a path through an environment, or acts out a desired motion in front of a video camera.

The discontinuities between the charts cause artifacts, and make it difficult to paint large areas with regular patterns. In this paper, our main contribution is a new quasi-conformal parameterization method, based on a least-squares approximation of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The so-defined objective function minimizes angle deformations, and we prove the following properties: the minimum is unique, independent of a similarity in texture space, independent of the resolution of the mesh and cannot generate triangle flips. The function is numerically well behaved and can therefore be very efficiently minimized. Our approach is robust, and can parameterize large charts with complex borders.

Presence is often defined as the sense of being there in a VE. There has been much debate about the best way to measure presence, and presence researchers need, and have sought, a measure that is reliable, valid, sensitive, and objective. We hypothesized that to the degree that a VE seems real, it would evoke physiological responses similar to those evoked by the corresponding real environment, and that greater presence would evoke a greater response. To examine this, we conducted three experiments, the results of which support the use of physiological reaction as a reliable, valid, sensitive, and objective presence measure. The experiments compared participants' physiological reactions to a non-threatening virtual room and their reactions to a stressful virtual height situation. We found that change in heart rate satisfied our requirements for a measure of presence, change in skin conductance did to a lesser extent, and that change in skin temperature did not. Moreover, the results showed that inclusion of a passive haptic element in the VE significantly increased presence and that for presence evoked: 30FPS > 20FPS > 15FPS.  In order to study a VE's effectiveness in evoking presence, researchers need a well-designed and verified measure of the phenomena. This paper reports our evaluation of three physiological measures  heart rate, skin conductance, and skin temperature  as alternate operational measures of presence in stressful VEs. Since the concept and idea of measuring presence are heavily debated, finding a measure that could find wide acceptance would be ideal. In that hope, we investigated the reliability, validity, sensitivity, and objectivity of each physiological measure.  ",

We also describe a general search strategy, called the -coherent search, for fast BTF synthesis using surface textons. A BTF synthesized using our algorithm not only looks similar to the BTF sample in all viewing/lighthing conditions but also exhibits a consistent mesostructure when viewing and lighting directions change. Moreover, the synthesized BTF fits the target surface naturally and seamlessly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm with sample BTFs from various sources, including those measured from real-world textures. ",

Although the general problem of adding chromatic values to a greyscale image has no exact, objective solution, the current approach attempts to provide a method to help minimize the amount of human labor required for this task. Rather than choosing RGB colors from a palette to color individual components, we transfer the entire color \"mood\" of the source to the target image by matching luminance and texture information between the images. We choose to transfer only chromatic information and retain the original luminance values of the target image. Further, the procedure is enhanced by allowing the user to match areas of the two images with rectangular swatches. We show that this simple technique can be successfully applied to a variety of images and video, provided that texture and luminance are sufficiently distinct. The images generated demonstrate the potential and utility of our technique in a diverse set of application domains. ",

Because all steps are done using images, the method is named Image Based Flow Visualization (IBFV). With IBFV a wide variety of visualization techniques can be emulated. Flow can be visualized as moving textures with line integral convolution and spot noise. Arrow plots, streamlines, particles, and topological images can be generated by adding extra dye to the image. Unsteady flows, defined on arbitrary meshes, can be handled. IBFV achieves a high performance by using standard features of graphics hardware. Typically fifty frames per second are generated using standard graphics cards on PCs. Finally, IBFV is easy to understand, analyse, and implement. ",

Our technique enables morphing of imagebased objects whose geometry and surface properties are too difficult to model with traditional vision and graphics techniques. Light field morphing is not based on 3D reconstruction; instead it relies on ray correspondence, i.e., the correspondence between rays of the source and target light fields. We address two main issues in light field morphing: feature specification and visibility changes. For feature specification, we develop an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface (UI). The key to this UI is feature polygons, which are intuitively specified as 3D polygons and are used as a control mechanism for ray correspondence in the abstract 4D ray space. For handling visibility changes due to object shape changes, we introduce ray-space warping. Ray-space warping can fill arbitrarily large holes caused by object shape changes; these holes are usually too large to be properly handled by traditional image warping. Our method can deal with non-Lambertian surfaces, including specular surfaces (with dense light fields).

Abstract We introduce structured importance sampling, a new technique for efficiently rendering scenes illuminated by distant natural illumination given in an environment map. Our method handles occlusion, high-frequency lighting, and is significantly faster than alternative methods based on Monte Carlo sampling. We achieve this speedup as a result of several ideas. First, we present a new metric for stratifying and sampling an environment map taking into account both the illumination intensity as well as the expected variance due to occlusion within the scene. We then present a novel hierarchical stratification algorithm that uses our metric to automatically stratify the environment map into regular strata. This approach enables a number of rendering optimizations, such as pre-integrating the illumination within each stratum to eliminate noise at the cost of adding bias, and sorting the strata to reduce the number of sample rays. We have rendered several scenes illuminated by natural lighting, and our results indicate that structured importance sampling is better than the best previous Monte Carlo techniques, requiring one to two orders of magnitude fewer samples for the same image quality.",

As a result, the triangle may be culled by primitives that were submitted after it. We show two- to fourfold efficiency improvements in pixel processing and video memory bandwidth usage in common benchmark scenes. We also demonstrate how the memory requirements of order-independent transparency can be substantially reduced by using delay streams.

Those capabilities have been very limited because the resources on such devices are extremely scarce; small amounts of memory, little bandwidth, little chip area dedicated for special purposes, and limited power consumption. The small display resolutions present a further challenge; the angle subtended by a pixel is relatively large, and therefore reasonably high quality rendering is needed to generate high fidelity images. To increase the mobile rendering capabilities, we propose a new hardware architecture for rasterizing textured triangles. Our architecture focuses on saving memory bandwidth, since an external memory access typically is one of the most energy-consuming operations, and because mobile phones need to use as little power as possible. Therefore, our system includes three new key innovations: I) an inexpensive multisampling scheme that gives relatively high quality at the same cost of previous inexpensive schemes, II) a texture minification system, including texture compression, which gives quality relatively close to trilinear mipmapping at the cost of 1.33 32-bit memory accesses on average, III) a scanline-based culling scheme that avoids a significant amount of z-buffer reads, and that only requires one context.

After extracting and smoothing the curvature tensor field of an input genus-0 surface patch, lines of minimum and maximum curvatures are used to determine appropriate edges for the remeshed version in anisotropic regions, while spherical regions are simply pointsampled since there is no natural direction of symmetry locally.

This enables us to implement the algorithm using programmable graphics hardware, and it results in images that most often are indistinguishable from images created as the average of 1024 hard shadow images. Furthermore, our algorithm can use both arbitrary shadow casters and receivers. Also, one version of our algorithm completely avoids sampling artifacts which is rare for soft shadow algorithms. As a bonus, the four-dimensional texture lookup allows for small textured light sources, and, even video textures can be used as light sources.

Past approaches to clothcloth collision have used history to decide whether nearby cloth regions have interpenetrated. The biggest pitfall of history-based methods is that an error anywhere along the way can give rise to persistent tangles. This is a particularly serious issue for production character animation, because characters' bodies routinely selfintersect, for instance in the bend of an elbow or knee, or where the arm or hand rests against the body. Cloth that becomes pinched in these regions is often forced into jagged self-intersections that defeat history-based methods, leaving a tangled mess when the body parts separate. This paper describes a history-free cloth collision response algorithm based on global intersection analysis of cloth meshes at each simulation step. The algorithm resolves tangles that arise during pinching as soon as the surrounding geometry permits, and also resolves tangled initial conditions. The ability to untangle cloth after pinching is not sufficient, because standard clothsolid collision algorithms handle pinches so poorly that they often give rise to visible flutters and other simulation artifacts during the pinch. As a companion to the global intersection analysis method, we present a cloth-solid collision algorithm called collision flypapering, that eliminates these artifacts. The two algorithms presented have been used together extensively and successfully in a production animation environment. ",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a technique for estimating the spatially-varying reflectance properties of a surface based on its appearance during a single pass of a linear light source. By using a linear light rather than a point light source as the illuminant, we are able to reliably observe and estimate the diffuse color, specular color, and specular roughness of each point of the surface. The reflectometry apparatus we use is simple and inexpensive to build, requiring a single direction of motion for the light source and a fixed camera viewpoint. Our model fitting technique first renders a reflectance table of how diffuse and specular reflectance lobes would appear under moving linear light source illumination. Then, for each pixel we compare its series of intensity values to the tabulated reflectance lobes to determine which reflectance model parameters most closely produce the observed reflectance values. Using two passes of the linear light source at different angles, we can also estimate per-pixel surface normals as well as the reflectance parameters. Additionally our system records a per-pixel height map for the object and estimates its per-pixel translucency. We produce real-time renderings of the captured objects using a custom hardware shading algorithm. We apply the technique to a test object exhibiting a variety of materials as well as to an illuminated manuscript with gold lettering. To demonstrate the technique's accuracy, we compare renderings of the captured models to real photographs of the original objects. ",

To create such images, one needs to be able to reproduce at non-specular reflection angles the same colors, by standard inks alone or in combination with a metallic ink. Accurate color prediction models need to be established which model the underlying physical phenomena in a consistent manner. To meet this challenge, we propose two models, one for predicting the reflection spectra of standard inks on coated paper and one for predicting the reflection spectra of a combination of standard inks and a metallic ink.

We explain the sources of these effects using a model of a hair fiber as a transparent elliptical cylinder with an absorbing interior and a surface covered with tilted scales. Based on an analytical scattering function for a circular cylinder, we propose a practical shading model for hair that qualitatively matches the scattering behavior shown in the measurements. In a comparison between a photograph and rendered images, we demonstrate the new model's ability to match the appearance of real hair. ",

By exploiting the richness in angular and spatial variation of the light field, objects can be relit with a high degree of realism. We record photographs of an object, illuminated from various positions and directions, using a projector mounted on a gantry as a moving light source. The resulting basis images are used to create a subset of the full reflectance field of the object. Using this reflectance field, we can create an image of the object, relit with any incident light field and observed from a fixed camera position. To maintain acceptable recording times and reduce the amount of data, we propose an efficient data acquisition method. Since the object can be relit with a 4D incident light field, illumination effects encoded in the light field, such as shafts of shadow or spot light effects, can be realized. ",

        "abstract": "Good character animation requires convincing skin deformations including subtleties and details like muscle bulges. Such effects are typically created in commercial animation packages which provide very general and powerful tools. While these systems are convenient and flexible for artists, the generality often leads to characters that are slow to compute or that require a substantial amount of memory and thus cannot be used in interactive systems. Instead, interactive systems restrict artists to a specific character deformation model which is fast and memory efficient but is notoriously difficult to author and can suffer from many deformation artifacts. This paper presents an automated framework that allows character artists to use the full complement of tools in high-end systems to create characters for interactive systems. Our method starts with an arbitrarily rigged character in an animation system. A set of examples is exported, consisting of skeleton configurations paired with the deformed geometry as static meshes. Using these examples, we fit the parameters of a deformation model that best approximates the original data yet remains fast to compute and compact in memory. ",

Our approach gives us considerable flexibility in the choice of local shape functions, and in particular we can accurately represent sharp features such as edges and corners by selecting appropriate shape functions. An error-controlled subdivision leads to an adaptive approximation whose time and memory consumption depends on the required accuracy. Due to the separation of local approximation and local blending, the representation is not global and can be created and evaluated rapidly.

To date, no generic means of evaluating or predicting the fidelity, either physical or visual, of the dynamic events occurring in an animation exists. As a first step towards providing such a metric, we present a set of psychophysical experiments that established some thresholds for human sensitivity to dynamic anomalies, including angular, momentum and spatio-temporal distortions applied to simple animations depicting the elastic collision of two rigid objects. In addition to finding significant acceptance thresholds for these distortions under varying conditions, we identified some interesting biases that indicate non-symmetric responses to these distortions (e.g., expansion of the angle between postcollision trajectories was preferred to contraction and increases in velocity were preferred to decreases). Based on these results, we derived a set of probability functions that can be used to evaluate the visual fidelity of a physically based simulation. To illustrate how our results could be used, two simple case studies of simulation levels of detail and constrained dynamics are presented. ",

PRT records over many surface points a transfer matrix. At run-time, this matrix transforms a vector of spherical harmonic coefficients representing distant, low-frequency source lighting into exiting radiance. Per-point transfer matrices form a high-dimensional surface signal that we compress using clustered principal component analysis (CPCA), which partitions many samples into fewer clusters each approximating the signal as an affine subspace. CPCA thus reduces the high-dimensional transfer signal to a low-dimensional set of perpoint weights on a per-cluster set of representative matrices. Rather than computing a weighted sum of representatives and applying this result to the lighting, we apply the representatives to the lighting per-cluster (on the CPU) and weight these results perpoint (on the GPU). Since the output of the matrix is lowerdimensional than the matrix itself, this reduces computation. We also increase the accuracy of encoded radiance functions with a new least-squares optimal projection of spherical harmonics onto the hemisphere.

A meso-scale is finely sampled over a small patch to provide local texture. Low-order (25D) spherical harmonics represent lowfrequency lighting dependence for both scales. To render, a coefficient vector representing distant source lighting is first transformed at the macro-scale by a matrix at each vertex of a coarse mesh. The resulting vectors represent a spatially-varying hemisphere of lighting incident to the meso-scale. A 4D function, called a radiance transfer texture (RTT), then specifies the surface's meso-scale response to each lighting basis component, as a function of a spatial index and a view direction. Finally, a 25D dot product of the macro-scale result vector with the vector looked up from the RTT performs the correct shading integral. We use an id map to place RTT samples from a small patch over the entire object; only two scalars are specified at high spatial resolution.

        "abstract": "We present an approach for decorating surfaces with progressivelyvariant textures. Unlike a homogeneous texture, a progressivelyvariant texture can model local texture variations, including the scale, orientation, color, and shape variations of texture elements. We describe techniques for modeling progressively-variant textures in 2D as well as for synthesizing them over surfaces. For 2D texture modeling, our feature-based warping technique allows the user to control the shape variations of texture elements, making it possible to capture complex texture variations such as those seen in animal coat patterns. In addition, our feature-based blending technique can create a smooth transition between two given homogeneous textures, with progressive changes of both shapes and colors of texture elements. For synthesizing textures over surfaces, the biggest challenge is that the synthesized texture elements tend to break apart as they progressively vary. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm based on texton masks, which mark most prominent texture elements in the 2D texture sample. By leveraging the power of texton masks, our algorithm can maintain the integrity of the synthesized texture elements on the target surface. ",

To obtain a suitable parameter set for the threshold modulation, a cost function used for the search of optimal parameters is designed. An optimal diffusion parameter set, as well as the corresponding threshold modulation strength values, is thus obtained. Experiments over this new set of parameters show that, compared with the original variable-coefficient error-diffusion algorithm, threshold modulation can remove visual anomalies more effectively. The result of the new algorithm is an artifact-free halftoning in the full range of intensities. Fourier analysis of the experimental results further support this conclusion.",

Also central to the framework is a suite of interactive tools that allow the user to specify a variety of high-level image objectives, either globally across the image, or locally through a painting-style interface. Image objectives are applied independently at each pixel location and generally involve a function of the pixel values (such as \"maximum contrast\") drawn from that same location in the set of source images. Typically, a user applies a series of image objectives iteratively in order to create a finished composite. The power of this framework lies in its generality; we show how it can be used for a wide variety of applications, including \"selective composites\" (for instance, group photos in which everyone looks their best), relighting, extended depth of field, panoramic stitching, clean-plate production, stroboscopic visualization of movement, and time-lapse mosaics.

Many good automatic texture atlas generation methods exist that evenly distribute texture samples across a surface based on its area and/or curvature, and some are even sensitive to the frequency spectrum of the input texture. However, during the surface painting process, the texture can change non-uniformly and unpredictably and even the best atlases are static and can thus fail to reproduce sections of finely painted detail such as surface illustration. We present a new texture atlas algorithm that distributes initial texture samples evenly according to surface area and texture frequency, and, more importantly, maintains this distribution as the texture signal changes during the surface painting process. The running time is further accelerated with a novel GPU implementation of the surface painting process. The redistribution of samples is transparent to the user, resulting in a surface painting system of seemingly unlimited resolution.

Appropriate boundary constraints are introduced in the simplification to ensure that all conforming selective subdivisions of the tetrahedron hierarchy lead to correctly matching surface patches.

Moir images appear when superposing a base layer made of replicated base bands and a revealing layer made of a line grating comprising thin transparent lines. Each replicated base band contains the same image, e.g. text or color motifs. Since the base bands and the revealing line grating have similar periods, the revealed moir image is the image located within each base band, enlarged along one dimension. By considering the formation of the moir image as a line sampling process, we derive the linear transformation between the base layer and the moir image. We obtain the geometric layout of the resulting moir image, i.e. its orientation, size and displacement direction when moving the revealing layer on top of the base layer. Interesting moir images can be synthesized by applying geometric transformations to both the base and the revealing layers. We propose a mathematical model describing the geometric transformation that a moir image undergoes, when its base layer and its revealing layer are subject to different freely chosen non-linear geometric transformations. By knowing in advance the layout of a moir image as a function of the layouts of the base layer and of the revealing layer, we are able to create moir components running up and down at different speeds and orientations upon translation of the revealing layer.

The system consists of a 3D viewer client that includes lowresolution versions of the 3D models, and a rendering server that renders and returns images of high-resolution models according to client requests. The server implements a number of defenses to guard against 3D reconstruction attacks, such as monitoring and limiting request streams, and slightly perturbing and distorting the rendered images. We consider several possible types of reconstruction attacks on such a rendering server, and we examine how these attacks can be defended against without excessively compromising the interactive experience for non-malicious users.

This paper provides automated methods for identifying logically similar motions in a data set and using them to build a continuous and intuitively parameterized space of motions. To find logically similar motions that are numerically dissimilar, our search method employs a novel distance metric to find \"close\" motions and then uses them as intermediaries to find more distant motions. Search queries are answered at interactive speeds through a precomputation that compactly represents all possibly similar motion segments. Once a set of related motions has been extracted, we automatically register them and apply blending techniques to create a continuous space of motions. Given a function that defines relevant motion parameters, we present a method for extracting motions from this space that accurately possess new parameters requested by the user. Our algorithm extends previous work by explicitly constraining blend weights to reasonable values and having a run-time cost that is nearly independent of the number of example motions. We present experimental results on a test data set of 37, 000 frames, or about ten minutes of motion sampled at 60 Hz. ",

This mapping, or crossparameterization, typically needs to preserve the shape and features of the parameterized models, mapping legs to legs, ears to ears, and so on. Most of the applications also require the models to be represented by compatible meshes, i.e. meshes with identical connectivity, based on the cross-parameterization. In this paper we introduce novel methods for shape preserving cross-parameterization and compatible remeshing. Our crossparameterization method computes a low-distortion bijective mapping between models that satisfies user prescribed constraints. Using this mapping, the remeshing algorithm preserves the user-defined feature vertex correspondence and the shape correlation between the models. The remeshing algorithm generates output meshes with significantly fewer elements compared to previous techniques, while accurately approximating the input geometry. As demonstrated by the examples, the compatible meshes we construct are ideally suitable for morphing and other geometry processing applications. ",

We formalize this premise using a quadratic cost function and obtain an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using standard techniques. In our approach an artist only needs to annotate the image with a few color scribbles, and the indicated colors are automatically propagated in both space and time to produce a fully colorized image or sequence.

Our paper presents a fundamentally graphics based approach to this `lost in hyperspace' problem. Specifically, we propose that spatial display of files is not sufficient to engage our visual skills; scenery (distinctive visual appearance) is needed as well. While scenery (in the form of custom icon assignments) is already possible in current operating systems, few if any users take the time to manually assign icons to all their files. As such, our proposal is to generate visually distinctive icons (\"VisualIDs\") automatically, while allowing the user to replace the icon if desired. The paper discusses psychological and conceptual issues relating to icons, visual memory, and the necessary relation of scenery to data. A particular icon generation algorithm is described; subjects using these icons in simulated file search and recall tasks show significantly improved performance with little effort.

Besides video encoding, the proposed quantization provides perceptually-optimized luminance sampling for fast implementation of any global tone mapping operator using a lookup table.

Our approach is to approximate the mesh model by a set of continuous triangle strips with no internal vertices. Initially, we subdivide our mesh into parts corresponding to the features of the model. We segment each part into zonal regions, grouping triangles which are similar topological distances from the part boundary. We generate triangle strips by simplifying the mesh while retaining the borders of the zonal regions and additional cut-lines. The pattern is then created simply by unfolding the set of strips. The distinguishing feature of our method is that we approximate a mesh model by a set of continuous strips, not by other ruled surfaces such as parts of cones or cylinders. Thus, the approximated unfolded pattern can be generated using only mesh operations and a simple unfolding algorithm. Furthermore, a set of strips can be crafted just by bending the paper (without breaking edges) and can represent smooth features of the original mesh models.",

We show how addition of a photo-sensor to a wireless tag significantly extends its functionality to allow geometric operations - such as finding the 3D position of a tag, or detecting change in the shape of a tagged object. Tag data is presented to the user by direct projection using a handheld locale-aware mobile projector. We introduce a novel technique that we call interactive projection to allow a user to interact with projected information e.g. to navigate or update the projected information. The ideas are demonstrated using objects with active radio frequency (RF) tags. But the work was motivated by the advent of unpowered passive-RFID, a technology that promises to have significant impact in real-world applications. We discuss how our current prototypes could evolve to passive-RFID in the future. ",

We use a camera with multiple flashes that are strategically positioned to cast shadows along depth discontinuities in the scene. The projective-geometric relationship of the camera-flash setup is then exploited to detect depth discontinuities and distinguish them from intensity edges due to material discontinuities. We introduce depiction methods that utilize the detected edge features to generate stylized static and animated images. We can highlight the detected features, suppress unnecessary details or combine features from multiple images. The resulting images more clearly convey the 3D structure of the imaged scenes. We take a very different approach to capturing geometric features of a scene than traditional approaches that require reconstructing a 3D model. This results in a method that is both surprisingly simple and computationally efficient. The entire hardware/software setup can conceivably be packaged into a self-contained device no larger than existing digital cameras. ",

An important property of this new metric is that it predicts component importances from inexpensive estimates of the reflectance properties of a scene, and therefore adds negligible overhead to the rendering process.

Our approach dynamically eliminates inaudible sources and groups the remaining audible sources into a budget number of clusters. Each cluster is represented by one impostor sound source, positioned using perceptual criteria. Spatial audio processing is then performed only on the impostor sound sources rather than on every original source thus greatly reducing the computational cost. A pilot validation study shows that degradation in audio quality, as well as localization impairment, are limited and do not seem to vary significantly with the cluster budget.

Above that level, perceptibility of LOD control manipulations should be minimized, and detail contrast is a better predictor of perceptibility than detail size. Below that level, perceptibility must be maximized, and LOD should be improved as eccentricity rises or contrast drops.

The method is based on a representation that incorporates both articulated and non-rigid deformations. We learn a pose deformation model that derives the non-rigid surface deformation as a function of the pose of the articulated skeleton. We also learn a separate model of variation based on body shape. Our two models can be combined to produce 3D surface models with realistic muscle deformation for different people in different poses, when neither appear in the training set. We show how the model can be used for shape completion -- generating a complete surface mesh given a limited set of markers specifying the target shape. We present applications of shape completion to partial view completion and motion capture animation. In particular, our method is capable of constructing a high-quality animated surface model of a moving person, with realistic muscle deformation, using just a single static scan and a marker motion capture sequence of the person.

To trigger an action a target is crossed instead of clicked on. While the idea of crossing has been around for a while, there has been no complete implementation of an application so far. We introduce CrossY, a simple drawing application developed as a benchmark to demonstrate the feasibility of goal crossing as the basis for a graphical user interface. We show that crossing is not only as expressive as the current point-and-click interface, but also offers more flexibility in interaction design. In particular, crossing encourages the fluid composition of commands which supports the development of more fluid interfaces. While crossing was previously identified as a potential substitute for the classic point-and-click interaction, this work is the first to report on the practical aspects of implementing an interface based on goal crossing as the fundamental building block.",

Our method operates by decomposing the radiance field close to surfaces into separate far- and near-field components that can be approximated individually. By computing surface shading using these approximations, instead of directly querying the global illumination solution, we have been able to obtain rendering time speed ups on the order of 10 compared to previous acceleration methods. Our approximation schemes rely mainly on the assumptions that radiance due to distant objects will exhibit low spatial and angular variation, and that the visibility between a surface and nearby surfaces can be reasonably predicted by simple locationand orientation-based heuristics. Motivated by these assumptions, our far-field scheme uses scattered-data interpolation with spherical harmonics to represent spatial and angular variation, and our near-field scheme employs an aggressively simple visibility heuristic. For our test scenes, the errors introduced when our assumptions fail do not result in visually objectionable artifacts or easily noticeable deviation from a ground-truth solution. We also discuss how our near-field approximation can be used with standard local illumination algorithms to produce significantly improved images at only negligible additional cost. ",

Coefficients of these polynomials can be precomputed, for efficient runtime evaluation. This allows simulation of nonlinear dynamics using fast implicit Newmark subspace integrators, with subspace integration costs independent of geometric complexity.

It combines the advantages of view-dependent rendering with numerous additional features: the high performance rendering associated with static preoptimized geometry, the capability to display at both low and high resolution with minimal artefacts, and a low CPU usage since all the geomorphing is done on the GPU. Furthermore, the hierarchical subdivision of the model into a tree structure can be accomplished according to any spatial or topological criteria. This property is particularly useful in dealing with models with high resolution textures derived from digital photographs.

Existing methods, however, are insensitive to statistical properties, such as correlations between motions. In addition, they lack the capability to quantitatively evaluate the reliability of synthesized motions. This paper proposes a method that treats motion interpolations as statistical predictions of missing data in an arbitrarily definable parametric space. A practical technique of geostatistics, called universal kriging, is then introduced for statistically estimating the correlations between the dissimilarity of motions and the distance in the parametric space. Our method statistically optimizes interpolation kernels for given parameters at each frame, using a pose distance metric to efficiently analyze the correlation. Motions are accurately predicted for the spatial constraints represented in the parametric space, and they therefore have few undesirable artifacts, if any. This property alleviates the problem of spatial inconsistencies, such as foot-sliding, that are associated with many existing methods. Moreover, numerical estimates for the reliability of predictions enable motions to be adaptively sampled. Since the interpolation kernels are computed with a linear system in real-time, motions can be interactively edited using various spatial controls. ",

The main result is a theorem that, in the Fourier domain, a photograph formed by a full lens aperture is a 2D slice in the 4D light field. Photographs focused at different depths correspond to slices at different trajectories in the 4D space. The paper demonstrates the utility of this theorem in two different ways. First, the theorem is used to analyze the performance of digital refocusing, where one computes photographs focused at different depths from a single light field. The analysis shows in closed form that the sharpness of refocused photographs increases linearly with directional resolution. Second, the theorem yields a Fourier-domain algorithm for digital refocusing, where we extract the appropriate 2D slice of the light field's Fourier transform, and perform an inverse 2D Fourier transform. This method is faster than previous approaches. ",

Central to our method is a highly dynamic surface and volume sampling method that supports arbitrary crack initiation, propagation, and termination, while avoiding many of the stability problems of traditional mesh-based techniques. We explicitly model advancing crack fronts and associated fracture surfaces embedded in the simulation volume. When cutting through the material, crack fronts directly affect the coupling between simulation nodes, requiring a dynamic adaptation of the nodal shape functions. We show how local visibility tests and dynamic caching lead to an efficient implementation of these effects based on point collocation. Complex fracture patterns of interacting and branching cracks are handled using a small set of topological operations for splitting, merging, and terminating crack fronts. This allows continuous propagation of cracks with highly detailed fracture surfaces, independent of the spatial resolution of the simulation nodes, and provides effective mechanisms for controlling fracture paths. We demonstrate our method for a wide range of materials, from stiff elastic to highly plastic objects that exhibit brittle and/or ductile fracture. ",

This paper presents an interactive cinematic lighting system used in the production of computer-animated feature films containing environments of very high complexity, in which surface and light appearances are described using procedural RenderMan shaders. Our system provides lighting artists with high-quality previews at interactive framerates with only small approximations compared to the final rendered images.

During the traversal, each 3D cell in the tree front is subdivided into eight childcells. For each cell subdivision, both local geometry and connectivity changes are encoded, where the connectivity coding is guided by the geometry coding. Furthermore, prioritized cell subdivision is performed in the tree front to provide better rate-distortion (RD) performance. Experiments show that the proposed mesh coder outperforms the kd-tree algorithm in both geometry and connectivity coding efficiency.

In its simplest form, the technique can be used to take photographs without a camera; we demonstrate this by capturing a photograph using a projector and a photo-resistor. If the photo-resistor is replaced by a camera, we can produce a 4D dataset that allows for relighting with 2D incident illumination. Using an array of cameras we can produce a 6D slice of the 8D reflectance field that allows for relighting with arbitrary light fields. Since an array of cameras can operate in parallel without interference, whereas an array of light sources cannot, dual photography is fundamentally a more efficient way to capture such a 6D dataset than a system based on multiple projectors and one camera. As an example, we show how dual photography can be used to capture and relight scenes. ",

By spatially varying both the axes and coefficients of these basis functions, we can fit to spatially varying transfer signals. Compared to the spherical harmonic (SH) basis, the ZH basis yields a more compact approximation. More important, it can be trivially rotated whereas SH rotation is expensive and unsuited for dense per-vertex or per-pixel evaluation. This property allows, for the first time, PRT to be mapped onto deforming models which re-orient the local coordinate frame. We generate ZH transfer models by fitting to PRT signals simulated on meshes or simple parametric models for thin membranes and wrinkles. We show how shading with ZH transfer can be significantly accelerated by specializing to a given lighting environment.

However, the class of meaningful deformations varies from mesh to mesh and depends on mesh kinematics, which prescribes valid mesh configurations, and a selection mechanism for choosing among them. Drawing an analogy to the traditional use of skeleton-based inverse kinematics for posing skeletons, we define mesh-based inverse kinematics as the problem of finding meaningful mesh deformations that meet specified vertex constraints. Our solution relies on example meshes to indicate the class of meaningful deformations. Each example is represented with a feature vector of deformation gradients that capture the affine transformations which individual triangles undergo relative to a reference pose. To pose a mesh, our algorithm efficiently searches among all meshes with specified vertex positions to find the one that is closest to some pose in a nonlinear span of the example feature vectors. Since the search is not restricted to the span of example shapes, this produces compelling deformations even when the constraints require poses that are different from those observed in the examples. Furthermore, because the span is formed by a nonlinear blend of the example feature vectors, the blending component of our system may also be used independently to pose meshes by specifying blending weights or to compute multi-way morph sequences.

In developing a material model with these attributes, we capitalize on a key observation about the subsurface scattering characteristics of quasi-homogeneous materials at different scales.

Realistic rendering of leaves requires a sophisticated appearance model and accurate lighting computation. For leaf appearance we introduce a parametric model that describes leaves in terms of spatially-variant BRDFs and BTDFs. These BRDFs and BTDFs, incorporating analysis of subsurface scattering inside leaf tissues and rough surface scattering on leaf surfaces, can be measured from real leaves. More importantly, this description is compact and can be loaded into graphics hardware for fast run-time shading calculations, which are essential for achieving high frame rates. For lighting computation, we present an algorithm that extends the Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) approach to all-frequency lighting for leaves. In particular, we handle the combined illumination effects due to lowfrequency environment light and high-frequency sunlight. This is done by decomposing the local incident radiance of sunlight into direct and indirect components. The direct component, which contains most of the high frequencies, is not pre-computed with spherical harmonics as in PRT; instead it is evaluated on-the-fly using pre-computed light-visibility convolution data. We demonstrate our framework by the rendering of a variety of leaves and assemblies thereof. ",

The main idea of our technique is to precompute for each scene entity a shadow field that describes the shadowing effects of the entity at points around it. The shadow field for a light source, called a source radiance field (SRF), records radiance from an illuminant as cube maps at sampled points in its surrounding space. For an occluder, an object occlusion field (OOF) conversely represents in a similar manner the occlusion of radiance by an object. A fundamental difference between shadow fields and previous shadow computation concepts is that shadow fields can be precomputed independent of scene configuration. This is critical for dynamic scenes because, at any given instant, the shadow information at any receiver point can be rapidly computed as a simple combination of SRFs and OOFs according to the current scene configuration. Applications that particularly benefit from this technique include large dynamic scenes in which many instances of an entity can share a single shadow field. Our technique enables low-frequency shadowing effects in dynamic scenes in real-time and all-frequency shadows at interactive rates. ",

The graph need not form a solid meshing of the input mesh's interior; its edges simply connect nearby points in the volume. This graph's Laplacian encodes volumetric details as the difference between each point in the graph and the average of its neighbors. Preserving these volumetric details during deformation imposes a volumetric constraint that prevents unnatural changes in volume. We also include in the graph points a short distance outside the mesh to avoid local self-intersections. Volumetric detail preservation is represented by a quadric energy function. Minimizing it preserves details in a least-squares sense, distributing error uniformly over the whole deformed mesh. It can also be combined with conventional constraints involving surface positions, details or smoothness, and efficiently minimized by solving a sparse linear system. We apply this technique in a 2D curve-based deformation system allowing novice users to create pleasing deformations with little effort.

The brightness pattern of a rain streak typically includes speckles, multiple smeared highlights and curved brightness contours. In this work, we propose a new model for rain streak appearance that captures the complex interactions between the lighting direction, the viewing direction and the oscillating shape of the drop. Our model builds upon a raindrop oscillation model that has been developed in atmospheric sciences. We have measured rain streak appearances under a wide range of lighting and viewing conditions and empirically determined the oscillation parameters that are dominant in raindrops. Using these parameters, we have rendered thousands of rain streaks to create a database that captures the variations in streak appearance with respect to lighting and viewing directions. We have developed an efficient image-based rendering algorithm that uses our streak database to add rain to a single image or a captured video with moving objects and sources.

Note that all figures in this paper use Exaggerated Shading [Rusinkiewicz et al. 2006] to emphasize small geometric details. Abstract Detailed surface geometry contributes greatly to the visual realism of 3D face models. However, acquiring high-resolution face geometry is often tedious and expensive. Consequently, most face models used in games, virtual reality, or computer vision look unrealistically smooth. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical technique for the analysis and synthesis of small three-dimensional facial features, such as wrinkles and pores. We acquire high-resolution face geometry for people across a wide range of ages, genders, and races. For each scan, we separate the skin surface details from a smooth base mesh using displaced subdivision surfaces. Then, we analyze the resulting displacement maps using the texture analy-sis/synthesis framework of Heeger and Bergen, adapted to capture statistics that vary spatially across a face. Finally, we use the extracted statistics to synthesize plausible detail on face meshes of arbitrary subjects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in several applications, including analysis of facial texture in subjects with different ages and genders, interpolation between high-resolution face scans, adding detail to low-resolution face scans, and adjusting the apparent age of faces. In all cases, we are able to re-produce fine geometric details consistent with those observed in high resolution scans.",

Yet, there are a number of natural processes that cause surface appearance to vary dramatically, such as burning of wood, wetting and drying of rock and fabric, decay of fruit skins, and corrosion and rusting of steel and copper. In this paper, we take a significant step towards measuring, modeling, and rendering time-varying surface appearance. We describe the acquisition of the first time-varying database of 26 samples, encompassing a variety of natural processes including burning, drying, decay, and corrosion. Our main technical contribution is a Space-Time Appearance Factorization (STAF). This model factors space and time-varying effects. We derive an overall temporal appearance variation characteristic curve of the specific process, as well as space-dependent textures, rates, and offsets. This overall temporal curve controls different spatial locations evolve at the different rates, causing spatial patterns on the surface over time. We show that the model accurately represents a variety of phenomena. Moreover, it enables a number of novel rendering applications, such as transfer of the time-varying effect to a new static surface, control to accelerate time evolution in certain areas, extrapolation beyond the acquired sequence, and texture synthesis of time-varying appearance.

We use a deep frame-buffer containing a set of view samples, whose indirect illumination is recomputed from the direct illumination on a large set of gather samples, distributed around the scene. This direct-to-indirect transfer is a linear transform which is particularly large, given the size of the view and gather sets. This makes it hard to precompute, store and multiply with. We address this problem by representing the transform as a set of sparse matrices encoded in wavelet space. A hierarchical construction is used to impose a wavelet basis on the unstructured gather cloud, and an image-based approach is used to map the sparse matrix computations to the GPU. We precompute the transfer matrices using a hierarchical algorithm and a variation of photon mapping in less than three hours on one processor. We achieve high-quality indirect illumination at 10-20 frames per second for complex scenes with over 2 million polygons, with diffuse and glossy materials, and arbitrary direct lighting models (expressed using shaders). We compute perpixel indirect illumination without the need of irradiance caching or other subsampling techniques. ",

To handle nonlinear constraints, we cast mesh deformation as a nonlinear energy minimization problem and solve the problem using an iterative algorithm. The main challenges in solving this nonlinear problem are the slow convergence and numerical instability of the iterative solver. To address these issues, we develop a subspace technique that builds a coarse control mesh around the original mesh and projects the deformation energy and constraints onto the control mesh vertices using the mean value interpolation. The energy minimization is then carried out in the subspace formed by the control mesh vertices. Running in this subspace, our energy minimization solver is both fast and stable and it provides interactive responses.

Being able to take cloth captured from a flapping flag and attach it to a character to make a cape, or enhance the wrinkles on a simulated garment, would greatly enhance the usability and re-usability of deforming surface data.

Each image shows a subset of the same implicitly infinite point set: while zooming in, more points are shown to maintain the apparent density. Only the local visible area of the point set was evaluated for each image. Abstract Well distributed point sets play an important role in a variety of computer graphics contexts, such as anti-aliasing, global illumination, halftoning, non-photorealistic rendering, point-based modeling and rendering, and geometry processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for rapidly generating large point sets possessing a blue noise Fourier spectrum and high visual quality. Our technique generates non-periodic point sets, distributed over arbitrarily large areas. The local density of a point set may be prescribed by an arbitrary target density function, without any preset bound on the maximum density. Our technique is deterministic and tile-based; thus, any local portion of a potentially infinite point set may be consistently regenerated as needed. The memory footprint of the technique is constant, and the cost to generate any local portion of the point set is proportional to the integral over the target density in that area. These properties make our technique highly suitable for a variety of real-time interactive applications, some of which are demonstrated in the paper. Our technique utilizes a set of carefully constructed progressive and recursive blue noise Wang tiles. The use of Wang tiles enables the generation of infinite non-periodic tilings. The progressive point sets inside each tile are able to produce spatially varying point densities. Recursion allows our technique to adaptively subdivide tiles only where high density is required, and makes it possible to zoom into point sets by an arbitrary amount, while maintaining a constant apparent density.",

        "abstract": "To embrace the imminent transition from traditional low-contrast video (LDR) content to superior high dynamic range (HDR) content, we propose a novel backward-compatible HDR video compression (HDR MPEG) method. We introduce a compact reconstruction function that is used to decompose an HDR video stream into a residual stream and a standard LDR stream, which can be played on existing MPEG decoders, such as DVD players. The reconstruction function is finely tuned to the content of each HDR frame to achieve strong decorrelation between the LDR and residual streams, which minimizes the amount of redundant information. The size of the residual stream is further reduced by removing invisible details prior to compression using our HDR-enabled filter, which models luminance adaptation, contrast sensitivity, and visual masking based on the HDR content. Designed especially for DVD movie distribution, our HDR MPEG compression method features low storage requirements for HDR content resulting in a 30% size increase to an LDR video sequence. The proposed compression method does not impose restrictions or modify the appearance of the LDR or HDR video. This is important for backward compatibility of the LDR stream with current DVD appearance, and also enables independent fine tuning, tone mapping, and color grading of both streams. ",

Finally, the noisy solutions are projected onto the smooth basis to produce the final solution.

Perlis Many natural and man-made objects exhibit significant symmetries or contain repeated substructures. This paper presents a new algorithm that processes geometric models and efficiently discovers and extracts a compact representation of their Euclidean symmetries. These symmetries can be partial, approximate, or both. The method is based on matching simple local shape signatures in pairs and using these matches to accumulate evidence for symmetries in an appropriate transformation space. A clustering stage extracts potential significant symmetries of the object, followed by a verification step. Based on a statistical sampling analysis, we provide theoretical guarantees on the success rate of our algorithm. The extracted symmetry graph representation captures important highlevel information about the structure of a geometric model which in turn enables a large set of further processing operations, including shape compression, segmentation, consistent editing, symmetrization, indexing for retrieval, etc. ",

However, a volume of hair is a difficult scene to simulate because scattering from an individual fiber is very structured and forward directed, and because the radiance distributions that arise from many such scattering events remain quite directional. For these reasons, previous methods cannot compute accurate images substantially faster than Monte Carlo path tracing. This paper proposes a new physically accurate method for rendering hair that is based on previous volumetric photon mapping methods. The first pass generates a photon map by tracing particles through the hair geometry, depositing them along paths rather than at scattering events. The second pass ray traces the hair, computing direct illumination and looking up indirect radiance in the photon map. Photons are stored and looked up in 5D position-direction space to allow for the very directional radiance distributions that occur in hair. Together with a new radiance caching method for fibers, our method simulates difficult scattering problems in hair efficiently and with low noise. The new algorithm is validated against path tracing and also compared with a photograph of light scattering in real hair. ",

The appearance of these media is governed by several physical properties such as particle densities, shapes and sizes, which must be input (directly or indirectly) to a rendering algorithm to generate realistic images. While there has been significant progress in developing rendering techniques (for instance, volumetric Monte Carlo methods and analytic approximations), there are very few methods that measure or estimate these properties for media that are of relevance to computer graphics. In this paper, we present a simple device and technique for robustly estimating the properties of a broad class of participating media that can be either (a) diluted in water such as juices, beverages, paints and cleaning supplies, or (b) dissolved in water such as powders and sugar/salt crystals, or (c) suspended in water such as  impurities. The key idea is to dilute the concentrations of the media so that single scattering effects dominate and multiple scattering becomes negligible, leading to a simple and robust estimation algorithm. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches that require complicated or separate measurement setups for different types or properties of media, our method and setup can be used to measure media with a complete range of absorption and scattering properties from a single HDR photograph. Once the parameters of the diluted medium are estimated, a volumetric Monte Carlo technique may be used to create renderings of any medium concentration and with multiple scattering. We have measured the scattering parameters of forty commonly found materials, that can be immediately used by the computer graphics community. We can also create realistic images of combinations or mixtures of the original measured materials, thus giving the user a wide flexibility in making realistic images of participating media.   e-mail:srinivas@cs.cmu.edu  ",

In theory, the separation can be done with just two images taken with a high frequency binary illumination pattern and its complement. In practice, a larger number of images are used to overcome the optical and resolution limitations of the camera and the source. The approach does not require the material properties of objects and media in the scene to be known. However, we require that the illumination frequency is high enough to adequately sample the global components received by scene points. We present separation results for scenes that include complex interreflections, subsurface scattering and volumetric scattering. Several variants of the separation approach are also described. When a sinusoidal illumination pattern is used with different phase shifts, the separation can be done using just three images. When the computed images are of lower resolution than the source and the camera, smoothness constraints are used to perform the separation using a single image. Finally, in the case of a static scene that is lit by a simple point source, such as the sun, a moving occluder and a video camera can be used to do the separation. We also show several simple examples of how novel images of a scene can be computed from the separation results.",

The light transfer functions and light sources are modeled with spherical radial basis functions (SRBFs). A SRBF is a rotation-invariant function that depends on the geodesic distance between two points on the unit sphere. Rotating functions in SRBF representation is as straightforward as rotating the centers of SRBFs. Moreover, highfrequency signals are handled by adjusting the bandwidth parameters of SRBFs. To exploit inter-vertex coherence, the light transfer functions are further classified iteratively into disjoint clusters, and tensor approximation is applied within each cluster. Compared with previous methods, the proposed approach enables real-time rendering with comparable quality under high-frequency lighting environments. The data storage is also more compact than previous all-frequency PRT algorithms. ",

Compared to most depth recovery methods, our approach is more accurate near depth discontinuities. Furthermore, by using a coaxial projector-camera system, we ensure that depth is computed at all camera pixels, without any missing parts. We show that the recovered scene geometry can be used for refocus synthesis and for depth-based image composition. Using the same projector defocus model and estimation technique, we also propose a defocus compensation method that filters a projection image in a spatiallyvarying, depth-dependent manner to minimize its defocus blur after it is projected onto the scene. This method effectively increases the depth of field of a projector without modifying its optics. Finally, we present an algorithm that exploits projector defocus to reduce the strong pixelation artifacts produced by digital projectors, while preserving the quality of the projected image.

Unlike pixel-based image quilting, mesh quilting is based on stitching together 3D geometry elements. Our quilting algorithm finds corresponding geometry elements in adjacent texture patches, aligns elements through local deformation, and merges elements to seamlessly connect texture patches. For mesh quilting on curved surfaces, a critical issue is to reduce distortion of geometry elements inside the 3D space of the thin shell. To address this problem we introduce a low-distortion parameterization of the shell space so that geometry elements can be synthesized even on very curved objects without the visual distortion present in previous approaches.

Can this enormous volume of legacy content also be displayed effectively on HDR displays? We have carried out a series of rigorous psychophysical investigations to determine how LDR images are best displayed on a state-of-the-art HDR monitor, and to identify which stages of the HDR imaging pipeline are perceptually most critical. Our main findings are: (1) As expected, HDR displays outperform LDR ones. (2) Surprisingly, HDR images that are tonemapped for display on standard monitors are often no better than the best single LDR exposure from a bracketed sequence. (3) Most importantly of all, LDR data does not necessarily require sophisticated treatment to produce a compelling HDR experience. Simply boosting the range of an LDR image linearly to fit the HDR display can equal or even surpass the appearance of a true HDR image.

Then, we present a reduced model whose control variables are intelligently distributed across the surface, respecting the rigidity information and the geometry. Specifically, for each handle, the control variables are the transformations of the isolines of a harmonic scalar field representing the deformation propagation from that handle. The isolines constitute a virtual skeletal structure similar to the bones in skinning deformation, thus correctly capturing the low-frequency shape deformation. To interpolate the transformations from the isolines to the original mesh, we design a method which is local, linear and geometry-dependent. This novel interpolation scheme and the transformation-based reduced domain allow each iteration of the nonlinear solver to be fully computed over the reduced domain. This makes the per-iteration cost dependent on only the number of isolines and enables compelling deformation of highly detailed shapes at interactive rates.

It allows for the generation (nucleation) of bubbles from gas dissolved in the fluid, the motion of the discrete bubbles including bubble collisions and drag interactions with the liquid which could be undergoing complex free surface motion, the formation and motion of coupled foams and the final dissipation of bubbles. This allows comprehensive simulations of dynamic bubble behavior. The underlying fluid simulation is based on the mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. Each particle representing the liquid contains an amount of dissolved gas. Gas is transferred from the continuum fluid model to the discrete bubble model at nucleation sites on the surface of solid bodies. The rate of gas transport to the nucleation sites controls the rate of bubble generation, producing very natural time variations in bubble numbers. Rising bubbles also grow by gathering more gas from the surrounding liquid as they move. This model contains significant bubble scale physics and allows, in principle, the capturing of many important processes that cannot be directly modeled by traditional methods. The method is used here to realistically animate the pouring of a glass of beer, starting with a stream of fresh beer entering the glass, the formation of a dense cloud of bubbles, which rise to create a good head as the beer reaches the top of the glass.

The load on the renderer can be alleviated by simplification techniques, which create less expensive representations of geometry that is small on the screen. Current simplification techniques for high-quality surface-based rendering tend to work best with element detail (i.e., detail due to the complexity of individual elements) but not as well with aggregate detail (i.e., detail due to the large number of elements). To address this latter type of detail, we introduce a stochastic technique related to some approaches used for point-based renderers. Scenes are rendered by randomly selecting a subset of the geometric elements and altering those elements statistically to preserve the overall appearance of the scene.

We first analyze to which extent different fluorescent inks can be superposed. Due to the quenching effect, at high concentrations of the fluorescent molecules, the fluorescent effect diminishes. With an ink-jet printer capable of printing pixels at reduced dot sizes, we reduce the concentration of the individual fluorescent inks and are able to create from the blue, red and greenish-yellow inks the new colorants white and magenta.

Such long lasting bubbles simulated by the level set method can suffer from a small but steady volume error that accumulates to a visible amount of volume change. We propose to address this problem by using the volume control method. We track the volume change of each connected region, and apply a carefully computed divergence that compensates undesired volume changes. To compute the divergence, we construct a mathematical model of the volume change, choose control strategies that regulate the modeled volume error, and establish methods to compute the control gains that provide robust and fast reduction of the volume error, and (if desired) the control of how the volume changes over time.

Although general purpose upsampling methods can be used to interpolate the low resolution solution to the full resolution, these methods generally assume a smoothness prior for the interpolation.

We thus render lines along tone boundaries or thin dark areas in the shaded image. We extend this notion to the dual: we render highlight lines along thin bright areas and tone boundaries. We combine the lines with toon shading to capture broad regions of tone. The resulting line drawings effectively convey both shape and material cues. The lines produced by the method can include silhouettes, creases, and ridges, along with a generalization of suggestive contours that responds to lighting as well as viewing changes. The method supports automatic level of abstraction, where the size of depicted shape features adjusts appropriately as the camera zooms in or out. Animated models can be rendered in real time because costly mesh curvature calculations are not needed.  Recently, DeCarlo et al. [2003; 2004] described \"suggestive contours,\" a new type of line that can be combined with silhouettes to produce effective line drawings of smooth shapes. They described two algorithms for rendering these. The first is an object-space algorithm that computes a subset of points on the surface where radial curvature is zero. The second is an image-space algorithm that operates on a diffuse-shaded rendering of the scene using a single point light at the camera. It outputs lines where the tone has a sufficiently sharp local minimum in one direction. While suggestive contours convey shape well, they have some limitations. The object space algorithm does not account for how large the object appears in the image, and so may depict features that are too large or small for the current view. Suggestive contours do not depend on lighting or material properties, which is undesirable when we want the lines to reinforce existing lighting and material cues, as when some form of shading is used in combination with the lines.

Using a statistical model of images, we can recover both depth information and an all-focus image from single photographs taken with the modified camera. A layered depth map is then extracted, requiring user-drawn strokes to clarify layer assignments in some cases.

The vertices or pixels are partitioned into smaller coherent regions, and light transport in each region is approximated by a locally low dimensional subspace using PCA. Many earlier techniques such as surface light field and reflectance field compression use a similar paradigm. However, there has been no clear theoretical understanding of how light transport dimensionality increases with local patch size, nor of the optimal block size or number of clusters. In this paper, we develop a theory of locally low dimensional light transport, by using Szego’s eigenvalue theorem to analytically derive the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix for canonical cases. We show mathematically that for symmetric patches of area A, the number of basis functions for glossy reflections increases linearly with A, while for simple cast shadows, it often increases as √A. These results are confirmed numerically on a number of test scenes. Next, we carry out an analysis of the cost of rendering, trading off local dimensionality and the number of patches, deriving an optimal block size. Based on this analysis, we provide useful practical insights for setting parameters in CPCA and also derive a new adaptive subdivision algorithm. Moreover, we show that rendering time scales sub-linearly with the resolution of the image, allowing for interactive all-frequency relighting of 1024×1024 images.",

Abstract We introduce Plushie, an interactive system that allows nonprofessional users to design their own original plush toys. To design a plush toy, one needs to construct an appropriate two-dimensional (2D) pattern. However, it is difficult for non-professional users to appropriately design a 2D pattern. Some recent systems automatically generate a 2D pattern for a given three-dimensional (3D) model, but constructing a 3D model is itself a challenge. Furthermore, an arbitrary 3D model cannot necessarily be realized as a real plush toy, and the final sewn result can be very different from the original 3D model. We avoid this mismatch by constructing appropriate 2D patterns and applying simple physical simulation to it on the fly during 3D modeling. In this way, the model on the screen is always a good approximation of the final sewn result, which makes the design process much more efficient. We use a sketching interface for 3D modeling and also provide various editing operations tailored for plush toy design. Internally, the system constructs a 2D cloth pattern in such a way that the simulation result matches the users input stroke. Our goal is to show that relatively simple algorithms can provide fast, satisfactory results to the user whereas the pursuit of optimal layout and simulation accuracy lies outside this papers scope.

        "abstract": "Efficient, realistic rendering of complex scenes is one of the grand challenges in computer graphics. Perceptually based rendering addresses this challenge by taking advantage of the limits of human vision. However, existing methods, based on predicting visible image differences, are too conservative because some kinds of image differences do not matter to human observers. In this paper, we introduce the concept of visual equivalence, a new standard for image fidelity in graphics. Images are visually equivalent if they convey the same impressions of scene appearance, even if they are visibly different. To understand this phenomenon, we conduct a series of experiments that explore how object geometry, material, and illumination interact to provide information about appearance, and we characterize how two kinds of transformations on illumination maps (blurring and warping) affect these appearance attributes. We then derive visual equivalence predictors (VEPs): metrics for predicting when images rendered with transformed illumination maps will be visually equivalent to images rendered with reference maps. We also run a confirmatory study to validate the effectiveness of these VEPs for general scenes. Finally, we show how VEPs can be used to improve the efficiency of two rendering algorithms: Light-cuts and precomputed radiance transfer. This work represents some promising first steps towards developing perceptual metrics based on higher order aspects of visual coding.",

We use tracking tags that work in natural lighting conditions and can be imperceptibly embedded in attire or other objects. Our system supports an unlimited number of tags in a scene, with each tag uniquely identified to eliminate marker reacquisition issues. Our tags also provide incident illumination data which can be used to match scene lighting when inserting synthetic elements. The technique is therefore ideal for on-set motion capture or real-time broadcasting of virtual sets. Unlike previous methods that employ high speed cameras or scanning lasers, we capture the scene appearance using the simplest possible optical devices - a light-emitting diode (LED) with a passive binary mask used as the transmitter and a photosensor used as the receiver. We strategically place a set of optical transmitters to spatio-temporally encode the volume of interest. Photosensors attached to scene points demultiplex the coded optical signals from multiple transmitters, allowing us to compute not only receiver location and orientation but also their incident illumination and the reflectance of the surfaces to which the photosensors are attached.

In particular, since scanned data is often incomplete, the reconstruction of the expected shape is an illposed problem. Techniques that reconstruct poorly-sampled areas without any user intervention fail in many cases to faithfully reconstruct the topology of the model. The method that we introduce in this paper is topology-aware: it uses minimal user input to make correct decisions at regions where the topology of the model cannot be automatically induced with a reasonable degree of confidence. We first construct a continuous function over a threedimensional domain. This function is constructed by minimizing a penalty function combining the data points, user constraints, and a regularization term. The optimization problem is formulated in a mesh-independent manner, and mapped onto a specific mesh using the finite-element method. The zero level-set of this function is a first approximation of the reconstructed surface. At complex undersampled regions, the constraints might be insufficient. Hence, we analyze the local topological stability of the zero level-set to detect weak regions of the surface. These regions are suggested to the user for adding local inside/outside constraints by merely scribbling over a 2D tablet. Each new user constraint modifies the minimization problem, which is solved incrementally. The process is repeated, converging to a topology-stable reconstruction.

The rendering performance is 2.62 fps when the viewpoint, BRDF, and lighting are all simultaneously changing; 10.94 fps when only the viewpoint and BRDF are dynamic; and 57.09 fps when only the viewpoint changes. Abstract We present a technique for interactive relighting in which source radiance, viewing direction, and BRDFs can all be changed on the fly. In handling dynamic BRDFs, our method efficiently accounts for the effects of BRDF modification on the reflectance and incident radiance at a surface point. For reflectance, we develop a BRDF tensor representation that can be factorized into adjustable terms for lighting, viewing, and BRDF parameters. For incident radiance, there exists a non-linear relationship between indirect lighting and BRDFs in a scene, which makes linear light transport frameworks such as PRT unsuitable. To overcome this problem, we introduce precomputed transfer tensors (PTTs) which decompose indirect lighting into precomputable components that are each a function of BRDFs in the scene, and can be rapidly combined at run time to correctly determine incident radiance. We additionally describe a method for efficient handling of high-frequency specular reflections by separating them from the BRDF tensor representation and processing them using precomputed visibility information. With relighting based on PTTs, interactive performance with indirect lighting is demonstrated in applications to BRDF animation and material tuning. ",

We develop a simple control strategy that can be used to generate a large variety of gaits and styles in real-time, including walking in all directions (forwards, backwards, sideways, turning), running, skipping, and hopping. Controllers can be authored using a small number of parameters, or their construction can be informed by motion capture data. The controllers are applied to 2D and 3D physically-simulated character models. Their robustness is demonstrated with respect to pushes in all directions, unexpected steps and slopes, and unexpected variations in kinematic and dynamic parameters. Direct transitions between controllers are demonstrated as well as parameterized control of changes in direction and speed. Feedback-error learning is applied to learn predictive torque models, which allows for the low-gain control that typifies many natural motions as well as producing smoother simulated motion. ",

        "abstract": "Taking satisfactory photos under dim lighting conditions using a hand-held camera is challenging. If the camera is set to a long exposure time, the image is blurred due to camera shake. On the other hand, the image is dark and noisy if it is taken with a short exposure time but with a high camera gain. By combining information extracted from both blurred and noisy images, however, we show in this paper how to produce a high quality image that cannot be obtained by simply denoising the noisy image, or deblurring the blurred image alone. Our approach is image deblurring with the help of the noisy image. First, both images are used to estimate an accurate blur kernel, which otherwise is difficult to obtain from a single blurred image. Second, and again using both images, a residual deconvolution is proposed to significantly reduce ringing artifacts inherent to image deconvolution. Third, the remaining ringing artifacts in smooth image regions are further suppressed by a gain-controlled deconvolution process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a number of indoor and outdoor images taken by off-the-shelf hand-held cameras in poor lighting environments.  taken are blurred or noisy. The brightness of the image can be increased in three ways. First, to reduce the shutter speed. But with a shutter speed below a safe shutter speed (the reciprocal of the focal length of the lens, in the unit of seconds), camera shake will result in a blurred image. Second, to use a large aperture. A large aperture will however reduce the depth of field. Moreover, the range of apertures in many cameras is very limited. Third, to set a high ISO. However, the high ISO image is very noisy because the noise is amplified as the camera's gain increases. To take a sharp image in a dim lighting environment, the best settings are: safe shutter speed, the largest aperture, and the highest ISO. Even with this combination, the captured image may still be dark and very noisy. Typically, two kinds of degraded image can be taken in the low light conditions. One is a blurred image which is taken with a slow shutter speed and a low ISO setting, as shown in Figure 1(a). With enough light, it has the correct color, intensity and a high SignalNoise Ratio (SNR). But it is blurry due to camera shake. The other is an underexposed and noisy image with a fast shutter speed and a high ISO setting, as shown in Figure 1(b). It is sharp but very noisy due to insufficient exposure and high camera gain. The colors of this image are also partially lost due to low contrast.  ",

The method is appropriate for most fluid simulation situations that do not involve significant global flow. It is demonstrated to work well in constrained areas, including wave reflections off of boundaries, and in unconstrained areas, such as an ocean surface. Interactions with floating objects are easily integrated by including wave forces on the objects and wave generation due to object motion.

Our system lets the user directly manipulate the surface using freely-selected surface points as handles.

To best preserve surface details, we develop a gradient domain technique that incorporates the handle position constraints and detail preserving objectives into the deformation energy. For displaced subdivision surfaces and surfaces with geometric textures, the deformation energy is highly nonlinear and cannot be handled with existing iterative solvers. To address this issue, we introduce a shell deformation solver, which replaces each numerically unstable iteration step with two stable mesh deformation operations. Our deformation algorithm only uses local operations and is thus suitable for GPU implementation. The result is a real-time deformation system running orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art multigrid mesh deformation solver.

To serve this purpose our method efficiently and effectively combines the power of surfaceand volume-based shape deformation techniques with a new mesh-based analysis-through-synthesis framework.

The algorithm allows registering raw noisy data, possibly contaminated with outliers, without pre-filtering or denoising the data. Further, the method significantly reduces the number of trials required to establish a reliable registration between the underlying surfaces in the presence of noise, without any assumptions about starting alignment. Our method is based on a novel technique to extract all coplanar 4-points sets from a 3D point set that are approximately congruent, under rigid transformation, to a given set of coplanar 4-points. This extraction procedure runs in roughly O(n2 + k) time, where n is the number of candidate points and k is the number of reported 4-points sets. In practice, when noise level is low and there is sufficient overlap, using local descriptors the time complexity reduces to O(n + k). We also propose an extension to handle similarity and affine transforms. Our technique achieves an order of magnitude asymptotic acceleration compared to common randomized alignment techniques. We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm on several sets of multiple range scans with varying degree of noise, outliers, and extent of overlap. ",

Abstract We present an intuitive and efficient method for editing the appearance of complex spatially-varying datasets, such as images and measured materials. In our framework, users specify rough adjustments that are refined interactively by enforcing the policy that similar edits are applied to spatially-close regions of similar appearance. Rather than proposing a specific user interface, our method allows artists to quickly and imprecisely specify the initial edits with any method or workflow they feel most comfortable with. An energy optimization formulation is used to propagate the initial rough adjustments to the final refined ones by enforcing the editing policy over all pairs of points in the dataset. We show that this formulation is equivalent to solving a large linear system defined by a dense matrix. We derive an approximate algorithm to compute such a solution interactively by taking advantage of the inherent structure of the matrix. We demonstrate our approach by editing images, HDR radiance maps, and measured materials.

The method first contracts the mesh geometry into a zero-volume skeletal shape by applying implicit Laplacian smoothing with global positional constraints. The contraction does not alter the mesh connectivity and retains the key features of the original mesh. The contracted mesh is then converted into a 1D curveskeleton through a connectivity surgery process to remove all the collapsed faces while preserving the shape of the contracted mesh and the original topology. The centeredness of the skeleton is refined by exploiting the induced skeleton-mesh mapping. In addition to producing a curve skeleton, the method generates other valuable information about the object's geometry, in particular, the skeletonvertex correspondence and the local thickness, which are useful for various applications.

Our approach differs from existing simulation techniques in the graphics and mechanics literature both in the kinematic description--we represent the material frame by its angular deviation from the natural Bishop frame-- as well as in the dynamical treatment--we treat the centerline as dynamic and the material frame as quasistatic. Additionally, we describe a manifold projection method for coupling rods to rigidbodies and simultaneously enforcing rod inextensibility. The use of quasistatics and constraints provides an efficient treatment for stiff twisting and stretching modes; at the same time, we retain the dynamic bending of the centerline and accurately reproduce the coupling between bending and twisting modes. We validate the discrete rod model via quantitative buckling, stability, and coupled-mode experiments, and via qualitative knot-tying comparisons.  Notably lacking is the application of DDG to physical modeling of elastic rods--curve-like elastic bodies that have one dimension (\"length\") much larger than the others (\"cross-section\"). Rods have many interesting potential applications in animating knots, sutures, plants, and even kinematic skeletons. They are ideal for modeling deformations characterized by stretching, bending, and twisting. Stretching and bending are captured by the deformation of a curve called the centerline, while twisting is captured by the rotation of a material frame associated to each point on the centerline. 1.1 Goals and contributions Our goal is to develop a principled model that is (a) simple to implement and efficient to execute and (b) easy to validate and test for convergence, in the sense that solutions to static problems and trajectories of dynamic problems in the discrete setup approach the solutions of the corresponding smooth problem.

First, given an input image, we detect all faces that are present, align them to the coordinate system used by our face library, and select candidate face images from our face library that are similar to the input face in appearance and pose.

Ours is the first technique to allow global illumination and near-field lighting effects between both real and synthetic objects at interactive rates, without needing a geometric and material model of the real scene. We achieve this by using a light field interface between real and synthetic components—thus, indirect illumination can be simulated using only two 4D light fields, one captured from and one projected onto the real scene. Multiple bounces of interreflections are obtained simply by iterating this approach. The interactivity of our technique enables its use with time-varying scenes, including dynamic objects. This is in sharp contrast to the alternative approach of using 6D or 8D light transport functions of real objects, which are very expensive in terms of acquisition and storage and hence not suitable for real-time applications. In our method, 4D radiance fields are simultaneously captured and projected by using a lens array, video camera, and digital projector.

One of the most effective approaches for synthesizing realistic clouds is to simulate cloud formation processes based on the atmospheric fluid dynamics. Although this approach can create realistic clouds, the resulting shapes and motion depend on many simulation parameters and the initial status. Therefore, it is very difficult to adjust those parameters so that the clouds form the desired shapes. This paper addresses this problem and presents a method for controlling the simulation of cloud formation. In this paper, we focus on controlling cumuliform cloud formation. The user specifies the overall shape of the clouds. Then, our method automatically adjusts parameters during the simulation in order to generate clouds forming the specified shape. Our method can generate realistic clouds while their shapes closely match to the desired shape. ",

Constrained to not deform at all in-plane but free to bend out-of-plane, these are an excellent approximation for many materials, including most cloth, paper, and stiffer materials. Unfortunately the conforming (geometrically continuous) discretizations used in graphics break down in this limit. Our nonconforming approach solves this problem, allowing us to simulate surfaces with zero in-plane deformation as a hard constraint. However, it produces discontinuous meshes, so we further couple this with a \"ghost\" conforming mesh for collision processing and rendering. We also propose a new second order accurate constrained mechanics time integration method that greatly reduces the numerical damping present in the usual first order methods used in graphics, for virtually no extra cost and sometimes significant speed-up.

In many of these applications, it is important to control the spatial scale of the extracted details, and it is often desirable to manipulate details at multiple scales, while avoiding visual artifacts. In this paper we introduce a new way to construct edge-preserving multi-scale image decompositions. We show that current base-detail decomposition techniques, based on the bilateral filter, are limited in their ability to extract detail at arbitrary scales. Instead, we advocate the use of an alternative edge-preserving smoothing operator, based on the weighted least squares optimization framework, which is particularly well suited for progressive coarsening of images and for multi-scale detail extraction. After describing this operator, we show how to use it to construct edge-preserving multi-scale decompositions, and compare it to the bilateral filter, as well as to other schemes. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our edge-preserving decompositions in the context of LDR and HDR tone mapping, detail enhancement, and other applications.",

While it is an open challenge to recover the functionality of a shape from its geometry alone, this paper shows that it is often possible to infer its upright orientation by analyzing its geometry. Our key idea is to reduce the two-dimensional (spherical) orientation space to a small set of orientation candidates using functionality-related geometric properties of the object, and then determine the best orientation using an assessment function of several functional geometric attributes defined with respect to each candidate. Specifically we focus on obtaining the upright orientation for man-made objects that typically stand on some flat surface (ground, floor, table, etc.), which include the vast majority of objects in our everyday surroundings. For these types of models orientation candidates can be defined according to static equilibrium. For each candidate, we introduce a set of discriminative attributes linking shape to function. We learn an assessment function of these attributes from a training set using a combination of Random Forest classifier and Support Vector Machine classifier. Experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes well and achieves about 90% prediction accuracy for both a 10-fold cross-validation over the training set and a validation with an independent test set.

The prototypes physically implement a reflectance field and generate different light fields depending on the incident illumination, for example light falling through a window. We discretize the incident light field using an optical system, and modulate it with a 2D pattern, creating a flat display which is view and illuminationdependent. It is free from electronic components. For distant light and a fixed observer position, we demonstrate a passive optical configuration which directly renders a 4D reflectance field in the realworld illumination behind it. We further propose an optical setup that allows for projecting out different angular distributions depending on the incident light direction. Combining multiple of these devices we build a display that renders a 6D experience, where the incident 2D illumination influences the outgoing light field, both in the spatial and in the angular domain. Possible applications of this technology are time-dependent displays driven by sunlight, object virtualization and programmable light benders / ray blockers without moving parts. ",

Using only a standard digital camera and a single view, we present a method for recovering models of predominantly diffuse textured surfaces that can be plausibly relit and viewed from any angle under any illumination. Our multiscale shape-from-shading technique uses diffuse-lit/flash-lit image pairs to produce an albedo map and textured height field. Using two lighting conditions enables us to subtract one from the other to estimate albedo. In the absence of a flash-lit image of a surface for which we already have a similar exemplar pair, we approximate both albedo and diffuse shading images using histogram matching. Our depth estimation is based on local visibility. Unlike other depth-from-shading approaches, all operations are performed on the diffuse shading image in image space, and we impose no constant albedo restrictions. An experimental validation shows our method works for a broad range of textured surfaces, and viewers are frequently unable to identify our results as synthetic in a randomized presentation. Furthermore, in side-by-side comparisons, subjects found a rendering of our depth map equally plausible to one generated from a laser range scan. We see this method as a significant advance in acquiring surface detail for texturing using a standard digital camera, with applications in architecture, archaeological reconstruction, games and special effects.",

We then compute weighted sums of the subband textures to accurately approximate noise with a desired spectrum. This allows us to achieve high-quality anisotropic filtering.

Our sampling technique operates on samples in the multidimensional space given by the rendering equation and as a consequence the value of each sample is noise-free. Our algorithm consists of two passes. In the first pass we adaptively generate samples in the multidimensional space, focusing on regions where the local contrast between samples is high. In the second pass we reconstruct the image by integrating the multidimensional function along all but the image dimensions. We perform a high quality anisotropic reconstruction by determining the extent of each sample in the multidimensional space using a structure tensor. We demonstrate our method on scenes with a 3 to 5 dimensional space, including soft shadows, motion blur, and depth of field.

Precomputed radiance transfer (PRT) and finite elements require a discrete representation of illumination over the scene. Non-hierarchical approaches such as per-vertex values are simple to implement, but lead to long precomputation. Hierarchical bases like wavelets lead to dramatic acceleration, but in their basic form they work well only on flat or smooth surfaces. We introduce a hierarchical function basis induced by scattered data approximation. It is decoupled from the geometric representation, allowing the hierarchical representation of illumination on complex objects. We present simple data structures and algorithms for constructing and evaluating the basis functions. Due to its hierarchical nature, our representation adapts to the complexity of the illumination, and can be queried at different scales. We demonstrate the power of the new basis in a novel precomputed direct-to-indirect light transport algorithm that greatly increases the complexity of scenes that can be handled by PRT approaches.

Proper elimination of this blur is challenging because the blur kernel is unknown, varies over the image as a function of object velocity, and destroys high frequencies. In the case of motions along a 1D direction (e.g. horizontal) we show that these challenges can be addressed using a camera that moves during the exposure. Through the analysis of motion blur as space-time integration, we show that a parabolic integration (corresponding to constant sensor acceleration) leads to motion blur that is invariant to object velocity. Thus, a single deconvolution kernel can be used to remove blur and create sharp images of scenes with objects moving at different speeds, without requiring any segmentation and without knowledge of the object speeds. Apart from motion invariance, we prove that the derived parabolic motion preserves image frequency content nearly optimally. That is, while static objects are degraded relative to their image from a static camera, a reliable reconstruction of all moving objects within a given velocities range is made possible. We have built a prototype camera and present successful deblurring results over a wide variety of human motions. ",

The key component in our approach is an automatic facial attractiveness engine trained on datasets of faces with accompanying facial attractiveness ratings collected from groups of human raters. Given a new face, we extract a set of distances between a variety of facial feature locations, which define a point in a high-dimensional \"face space\". We then search the face space for a nearby point with a higher predicted attractiveness rating. Once such a point is found, the corresponding facial distances are embedded in the plane and serve as a target to define a 2D warp field which maps the original facial features to their adjusted locations. The effectiveness of our technique was experimentally validated by independent rating experiments, which indicate that it is indeed capable of increasing the facial attractiveness of most portraits that we have experimented with.

        "abstract": "Previous research has shown that a global multiple scattering simulation is needed to achieve physically realistic renderings of hair, particularly light-colored hair with low absorption. However, previous methods have either sacrificed accuracy or have been too computationally expensive for practical use. In this paper we describe a physically based, volumetric rendering method that computes multiple scattering solutions, including directional effects, much faster than previous accurate methods. Our two-pass method first traces light paths through a volumetric representation of the hair, contributing power to a 3D grid of spherical harmonic coefficients that store the directional distribution of scattered radiance everywhere in the hair volume. Then, in a ray tracing pass, multiple scattering is computed by integrating the stored radiance against the scattering functions of visible fibers using an efficient matrix multiplication. Single scattering is computed using conventional direct illumination methods. In our comparisons the new method produces quality similar to that of the best previous methods, but computes multiple scattering more than 10 times faster.  Photon mapping methods have proven successful for hair rendering [Moon and Marschner 2006; Zinke 2008], but they are slow and require a large amount of storage for the photons. This paper proposes a new method for computing multiple scattering in hair. Like photon mapping, it uses a light tracing and a ray tracing pass, but it stores the position- and direction-dependent scattered radiance distribution in a 3D grid of coefficients for spherical harmonic basis functions. Compared to a photon map, this representation for radiance is more compact and better organized in memory, and it allows fast integration by sparse matrix multiplication during rendering. At the same time, we avoid the high cost of tracing paths from fiber to fiber by replacing the hair geometry with a voxel grid that stores density and orientation statistics, through which paths are traced by volumetric methods. The end result of adopting smooth representations for the essentially smooth phenomena of volume scattering in hair is that our new method outperforms an implementation of photon mapping based on the same ray tracing infrastructure [Moon and Marschner 2006] by a factor of 20 while achieving results of equivalent quality.

We first create a database of dynamic skin deformations by recording the motion of the surface of the skin with a very large set of motion capture markers. We then build a statistical model of the deformations by dividing them into two parts: static and dynamic. Static deformations are modeled as a function of pose. Dynamic deformations are caused by the actions of the muscles as they move the joints and the inertia of muscles and fat. We approximate these effects by fitting a set of dynamic equations to the pre-recorded data. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by generating skin deformations from the skeletal motion of an actor. We compare the generated animation both to synchronized video of the actor and to ground truth animation created directly from the large marker set.  A number of data-driven approaches to this problem have been published in the past few years. For example, Park and Hodgins [2006], Anguelov and colleagues [2005], and Sand and colleagues [2003] have used various data capture techniques to create animated figures with deforming body shapes. Park and Hodgins in particular captured and animated the jiggling and shaking that accompany dynamic motions. With their method, however, each new animated motion had to be captured with a marker set consisting of 300-400 markers. This marker set was time-consuming to apply and uncomfortable for the actor. In this paper, we develop techniques that use a database of pre-recorded dense marker data collected using their technique to construct static and dynamic models of the skin and muscle deformations. These models can then be used to animate deformations for skeletal motions that were recorded with a traditional marker set of 40-50 markers.  ",

Our holistic approach enhances the depiction of various visual cues, including gradients from surface shading, surface reflectance, shadows, and highlights, to ease estimation of viewpoint, lighting conditions, shapes of objects and their world-space organization. Motivated by recent perceptual findings on 3D aspects of the Cornsweet illusion, we create scene coherent enhancements by treating cues in terms of their 3D context; doing so has a stronger effect than approaches that operate in a 2D image context and also achieves temporal coherence. We validate our unsharp masking in 3D with psychophysical experiments showing that the enhanced images are perceived to have better contrast and are preferred over unenhanced originals.

Such an approach should provide easier shape recognition, better visual separation between objects and a clarification of their spatial arrangement solely by increasing the apparent contrast of specific visual cues. Instead of identifying and modifying cues separately, we look at their common cause, changes (or gradients) in reflected light. These light gradients include all cues caused by variations in surface geometry, material properties, incoming light properties and the spatial arrangement of objects. For example, where a surface receives different amounts of incoming light (possibly in shadow), where reflectance properties change, and where specular highlights occur.

Instead of removing 1D seams from 2D images we remove 2D seam manifolds from 3D space-time volumes. To achieve this we replace the dynamic programming method of seam carving with graph cuts that are suitable for 3D volumes. In the new formulation, a seam is given by a minimal cut in the graph and we show how to construct a graph such that the resulting cut is a valid seam. That is, the cut is monotonic and connected. In addition, we present a novel energy criterion that improves the visual quality of the retargeted images and videos. The original seam carving operator is focused on removing seams with the least amount of energy, ignoring energy that is introduced into the images and video by applying the operator. To counter this, the new criterion is looking forward in time removing seams that introduce the least amount of energy into the retargeted result. We show how to encode the improved criterion into graph cuts (for images and video) as well as dynamic programming (for images). We apply our technique to images and videos and present results of various applications.",

This provides dramatically higher performance per watt and per unit of area than out-of-order CPUs on highly parallel workloads. It also greatly increases the flexibility and programmability of the architecture as compared to standard GPUs. A coherent on-die 2nd level cache allows efficient inter-processor communication and high-bandwidth local data access by CPU cores. Task scheduling is performed entirely with software in Larrabee, rather than in fixed function logic. The customizable software graphics rendering pipeline for this architecture uses binning in order to reduce required memory bandwidth, minimize lock contention, and increase opportunities for parallelism relative to standard GPUs.

This will require scalable methods that can simulate every hair as opposed to only a few guide hairs. Novel to this approach is that the individual hair/hair interactions can be modeled with physical parameters (friction, static attraction, etc.) at the scale of a single hair as opposed to clumped or continuum interactions. In this vein, we first propose a new altitude spring model for preventing collapse in the simulation of volumetric tetrahedra, and we show that it is also applicable both to bending in cloth and torsion in hair. We demonstrate that this new torsion model for hair behaves in a fashion similar to more sophisticated models with significantly reduced computational cost. For added efficiency, we introduce a semi-implicit discretization of standard springs that makes them truly linear in multiple spatial dimensions and thus unconditionally stable without requiring Newton-Raphson iteration. We also simulate complex hair/hair interactions including sticking and clumping behavior, collisions with objects (e.g. head and shoulders) and self-collisions.

Our approach is based on a decomposition of the input smoke animation, represented as a sequence of volumetric density fields, into a set of radial basis functions (RBFs) and a sequence of residual fields. To expedite rendering, the source radiance distribution within the smoke is computed from only the lowfrequency RBF approximation of the density fields, since the highfrequency residuals have little impact on global illumination under low-frequency environment lighting. Furthermore, in computing source radiances the contributions from single and multiple scattering are evaluated at only the RBF centers and then approximated at other points in the volume using an RBF-based interpolation. A slice-based integration of these source radiances along each view ray is then performed to render the final image. The high-frequency residual fields, which are a critical component in the local appearance of smoke, are compensated back into the radiance integral during this ray march to generate images of high detail. The runtime algorithm, which includes both light transfer simulation and ray marching, can be easily implemented on the GPU, and thus allows for real-time manipulation of viewpoint and lighting, as well as interactive editing of smoke attributes such as extinction cross section, scattering albedo, and phase function.

We use this algorithm to implement an accelerated bilateral filter that respects full 3D color distance; accelerated non-local means on single images, volumes, and unaligned bursts of images for denoising; and a fast adaptation of non-local means to geometry. If we have n values to filter, and each is assigned a position in a d-dimensional space, then our space complexity is O(dn) and our time complexity is O(dn log n), whereas existing methods are typically either exponential in d or quadratic in n.",

        "abstract": "We show that motion blur in successive video frames is invertible even if the point-spread function (PSF) due to motion smear in a single photo is non-invertible. Blurred photos exhibit nulls (zeros) in the frequency transform of the PSF, leading to an ill-posed deconvolution. Hardware solutions to avoid this require specialized devices such as the coded exposure camera or accelerating sensor motion. We employ ordinary video cameras and introduce the notion of null-filling along with joint-invertibility of multiple blurfunctions. The key idea is to record the same object with varying PSFs, so that the nulls in the frequency component of one frame can be filled by other frames. The combined frequency transform becomes null-free, making deblurring well-posed. We achieve jointlyinvertible blur simply by changing the exposure time of successive frames. We address the problem of automatic deblurring of objects moving with constant velocity by solving the four critical components: preservation of all spatial frequencies, segmentation of moving parts, motion estimation of moving parts, and non-degradation of the static parts of the scene. We demonstrate several challenging cases of object motion blur including textured backgrounds and partial occluders. ",

The bunny has eight cycles, the rocker arm has only two cycles, and the genus-three object has 16 cycles. The first three models are created by the Quadcover method [Kalberer et al. 2007], courtesy of Wenping Wang and Li Yupei. The genus-three object is created using TopMod3D [Akleman et al. 2008]. Abstract In this paper, we show how to create plain-weaving over an arbitrary surface. To create a plain-weaving on a surface, we need to create cycles that cross other cycles (or themselves) by alternatingly going over and under. We use the fact that it is possible to create such cycles, starting from any given manifold-mesh surface by simply twisting every edge of the manifold mesh. We have developed a new method that converts plain-weaving cycles to 3D thread structures. Using this method, it is possible to cover a surface without large gaps between threads by controlling the sizes of the gaps. We have developed a system that converts any manifold mesh to a plain-woven object, by interactively controlling the shapes of the threads with a set of parameters. We have demonstrated that by using this system, we can create a wide variety of plain-weaving patterns, some of which may not have been seen before.",

We present Video SnapCut, a robust video object cutout system that significantly advances the state-of-the-art. In our system segmentation is achieved by the collaboration of a set of local classifiers, each adaptively integrating multiple local image features. We show how this segmentation paradigm naturally supports local user editing and propagates them across time. The object cutout system is completed with a novel coherent video matting technique.

With spline interpolation, however, it can be difficult to achieve secondary motion effects such as plausible dynamics when there are thousands of degrees of freedom to animate. Physical methods can provide more realism with less user effort, but it is challenging to apply them to quickly create specific animations that closely follow prescribed animator goals. We present a fast space-time optimization method to author physically based deformable object simulations that conform to animator-specified keyframes. We demonstrate our method with FEM deformable objects and mass-spring systems. Our method minimizes an objective function that penalizes the sum of keyframe deviations plus the deviation of the trajectory from physics. With existing methods, such minimizations operate in high dimensions, are slow, memory consuming, and prone to local minima. We demonstrate that significant computational speedups and robustness improvements can be achieved if the optimization problem is properly solved in a low-dimensional space. Selecting a low-dimensional space so that the intent of the animator is accommodated, and that at the same time space-time optimization is convergent and fast, is difficult. We present a method that generates a quality low-dimensional space using the given keyframes.

It can be used to deform shapes embedded in the ambient space and represented in various forms  polygon meshes, point clouds or volumetric data. For a space deformation method to be useful, it should possess some natural properties: e.g. detail preservation, smoothness and intuitive control. A harmonic map from a domain   Rd to Rd is a mapping whose d components are harmonic functions. Harmonic mappings are smooth and regular, and if their components are coupled in some special way, the mapping can be detail-preserving, making it a natural choice for space deformation applications. The challenge is to find a harmonic mapping of the domain, which will satisfy constraints specified by the user, yet also be detail-preserving, and intuitive to control. We generate harmonic mappings as a linear combination of a set of harmonic basis functions, which have a closed-form expression when the source region boundary is piecewise linear. This is done by defining an energy functional of the mapping, and minimizing it within the linear span of these basis functions. The resulting mapping is harmonic, and a natural \"As-Rigid-As-Possible\" deformation of the source region. Unlike other space deformation methods, our approach does not require an explicit discretization of the domain. It is shown to be much more efficient, yet generate comparable deformations to state-ofthe-art methods. We describe an optimization algorithm to minimize the deformation energy, which is robust, provably convergent, and easy to implement. ",

In contrast to previous methods, sparsely distributed directional constraints are sufficient to automatically determine the appropriate number, type and position of singularities in the quadrangulation.

Abstract Seamless cloning of a source image patch into a target image is an important and useful image editing operation, which has received considerable research attention in recent years. This operation is typically carried out by solving a Poisson equation with Dirich-let boundary conditions, which smoothly interpolates the discrepancies between the boundary of the source patch and the target across the entire cloned area.

The reduced inter-scale correlation allows us to avoid halo artifacts in band-independent multi-scale processing without taking any special precautions. We thus achieve nonlinear data-dependent multiscale edge-preserving image filtering and processing at computation times which are linear in the number of image pixels. The new wavelets encode, in their shape, the smoothness information of the image at every scale. We use this to derive a new edge-aware interpolation scheme that achieves results, previously computed by solving an inhomogeneous Laplace equation, through an explicit computation. We thus avoid the difficulties in solving large and poorly-conditioned systems of equations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new wavelet basis for various computational photography applications such as multi-scale dynamic-range compression, edge-preserving smoothing and detail enhancement, and image colorization.

We hypothesize that maintaining the properties of such a small number of wires allows preserving the defining characteristics of the entire object. We introduce an analyze-and-edit approach, where prior to editing, we perform a light-weight analysis of the input shape to extract a descriptive set of wires. Analyzing the individual and mutual properties of the wires, and augmenting them with geometric attributes makes them intelligent and ready to be manipulated. Editing the object by modifying the intelligent wires leads to a powerful editing framework that retains the original design intent and object characteristics.

We achieve these guarantees through a novel synthesis of asynchronous variational integrators, kinetic data structures, and a discretization of the contact barrier potential by an infinite sum of nested quadratic potentials. In a series of two- and threedimensional examples, we illustrate that this method more easily handles challenging problems involving complex contact geometries, sharp features, and sliding during extremely tight contact.

Challenging scenarios involve dynamics with frequent and distributed points of contact, interaction with sharp boundaries, resting and sliding contact, and combinations thereof. Useful resolution of these scenarios requires consideration of the fundamental issues of geometric safety, physical correctness, and computational progress, with the respective meanings that (a) for well-posed problems the simulation does not enter an invalid (interpenetrating) state, (b) collision response obeys physical laws of causality and conservation (of mass, momentum, energy, etc.), and (c) the algorithm completes a simulation in finite, preferrably short, time.

Traditional gridbased simulation models require large grids and long simulation times to capture even the coarsest levels of detail.

We also propose a simple, GPU-based volume rendering scheme. The resulting images of fire produced by the proposed techniques are extremely detailed and can be integrated seamlessly into film-resolution images. Our refinement technique takes advantage of perceptive limitations and likely viewing behavior to split the refinement stage into separable, parallel tasks. Multiple independent GPUs are employed to rapidly refine final simulations for rendering, allowing for rapid artist turnaround time and very high resolutions. Directability is achieved by allowing virtually any user-defined particle behavior as an input to the initial coarse simulation. The physical criteria enforced by the coarse stage are minimal and could be easily implemented using any of the wide variety of commercially available fluid simulation tools. The GPU techniques utilized by our refinement stage are simple and widely available on even consumer-grade GPUs, lowering the overall implementation cost of the proposed system. ",

Our system takes a data feed from a motion capture system as input, and in real-time translates the performance into corresponding actions in a virtual world. The difficulty with such an approach arises from the need to manage the discrepancy between the real and virtual world, leading to two important subproblems 1) recognizing the user's intention, and 2) simulating the appropriate action based on the intention and virtual context. We solve this issue by first enabling the virtual world's designer to specify possible activities in terms of prominent features of the world along with associated motion clips depicting interactions. We then integrate the prerecorded motions with online performance and dynamic simulation to synthesize seamless interaction of the virtual character in a simulated virtual world. The result is a flexible interface through which a user can make freeform control choices while the resulting character motion maintains both physical realism and the user's personal style. ",

To achieve correct vertical perspective, we further leverage this image to track the position of each audience member's eyes, allowing the 3D display to render correct vertical perspective for each of the viewers around the device.

The enrichment functions are stored in enrichment textures, which allows for fracture and cutting discontinuities at a resolution much finer than the underlying mesh, similar to image textures for increased visual resolution. Furthermore, we propose harmonic enrichment functions to handle multiple, intersecting, arbitrarily shaped, progressive cuts per element in a simple and unified framework.

To this date, no formal evaluation of the relative effectiveness of these methods has been performed. In this paper, we present a first step toward evaluating the three paradigms in the form of a user study with novice users. We focus our evaluation on simple tasks that directly affect lighting features, such as highlights, shadows and intensity gradients, in scenes with up to 2 point lights and 5 objects under direct illumination. We perform quantitative experiments to measure relative efficiency between interfaces together with qualitative input to explore the intuitiveness of the paradigms. Our results indicate that paint-based goal specification is more cumbersome than either direct or indirect manipulation. Furthermore, our investigation suggests improvements to not only the implementation of the paradigms, but also overall paradigm structure for further exploration.",

Secondly, our algorithm uses the concept of image manifolds, adapting surface parameterization and fitting techniques to generate the gradient mesh in a fully automatic manner. Existing gradient-mesh algorithms require manual interaction to guide grid construction, and to cut objects with holes into disk-like regions. Our new algorithm is empirically at least 10 times faster than previous approaches.

Recent advances in computational imaging modify the acquisition process to extend the DOF through deconvolution. Because deconvolution quality is a tight function of the frequency power spectrum of the defocus kernel, designs with high spectra are desirable. In this paper we study how to design effective extended-DOF systems, and show an upper bound on the maximal power spectrum that can be achieved. We analyze defocus kernels in the 4D light field space and show that in the frequency domain, only a low-dimensional 3D manifold contributes to focus. Thus, to maximize the defocus spectrum, imaging systems should concentrate their limited energy on this manifold. We review several computational imaging systems and show either that they spend energy outside the focal manifold or do not achieve a high spectrum over the DOF. Guided by this analysis we introduce the lattice-focal lens, which concentrates energy at the low-dimensional focal manifold and achieves a higher power spectrum than previous designs. We have built a prototype lattice-focal lens and present extended depth of field results. ",

Our approach is based on three observations. First, isometries are a subset of the Mobius group, which has low-dimensionality  six degrees of freedom for topological spheres, and three for topological discs. Second, computing the Mobius transformation that interpolates any three points can be computed in closed-form after a mid-edge flattening to the complex plane. Third, deviations from isometry can be modeled by a transportation-type distance between corresponding points in that plane. Motivated by these observations, we have developed a Mobius Voting algorithm that iteratively: 1) samples a triplet of three random points from each of two point sets, 2) uses the Mobius transformations defined by those triplets to map both point sets into a canonical coordinate frame on the complex plane, and 3) produces \"votes\" for predicted correspondences between the mutually closest points with magnitude representing their estimated deviation from isometry. The result of this process is a fuzzy correspondence matrix, which is converted to a permutation matrix with simple matrix operations and output as a discrete set of point correspondences with confidence values. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it can find intrinsic point correspondences in cases of extreme deformation. During experiments with a variety of data sets, we find that it is able to find dozens of point correspondences between different object types in different poses fully automatically. ",

The system is general to non-human morphologies and results in natural balancing motions employing the entire body (for example, wind-milling). Our novel balance routine seeks to control the linear and angular momenta of the character. We demonstrate how momentum is related to the center of mass and center of pressure of the character and derive control rules to change these centers for balance. The desired momentum changes are reconciled with the objective of tracking the reference motion through an optimization routine which produces target joint accelerations. A hybrid inverse/forward dynamics algorithm determines joint torques based on these joint accelerations and the ground reaction forces. Finally, the joint torques are applied to the free-standing character simulation. We demonstrate results for following both motion capture and keyframe data as well as both human and non-human morphologies in presence of a variety of conditions and disturbances. ",

        "abstract": "We describe a method for plausible interpolation of images, with a wide range of applications like temporal up-sampling for smooth playback of lower frame rate video, smooth view interpolation, and animation of still images. The method is based on the intuitive idea, that a given pixel in the interpolated frames traces out a path in the source images. Therefore, we simply move and copy pixel gradients from the input images along this path. A key innovation is to allow arbitrary (asymmetric) transition points, where the path moves from one image to the other. This flexible transition preserves the frequency content of the originals without ghosting or blurring, and maintains temporal coherence. Perhaps most importantly, our framework makes occlusion handling particularly simple. The transition points allow for matches away from the occluded regions, at any suitable point along the path. Indeed, occlusions do not need to be handled explicitly at all in our initial graph-cut optimization. Moreover, a simple comparison of computed path lengths after the optimization, allows us to robustly identify occluded regions, and compute the most plausible interpolation in those areas. Finally, we show that significant improvements are obtained by moving gradients and using Poisson reconstruction. ",

In this paper we show how to relax this restriction so that users can make stacking decisions on a per-overlap basis, as if the layers were pictures cut from a magazine. This allows for complex and visually exciting overlapping patterns, without painstaking layer-splitting, depth-value painting, region coloring, or mask-drawing. Instead, users are presented with a layers dialog which acts locally. Behind the scenes, we divide the image into overlap regions and track the ordering of layers in each region. We formalize this structure as a graph of stacking lists, define the set of orderings where layers do not interpenetrate as consistent, and prove that our local stacking operators are both correct and sufficient to reach any consistent stacking. We also provide a method for updating the local stacking when objects change shape or position due to user editing  this scheme prevents layer updates from producing undesired intersections.

Using an eye-tracking device, we recorded fixations on body parts while participants were asked to indicate whether clones were present or not. We found that the head and upper torso attract the majority of first fixations in a scene and are attended to most. This is true regardless of the orientation, presence or absence of motion, sex, age, size, and clothing style of the character. We developed a selective variation method to exploit this knowledge and perceptually validated our method. We found that selective colour variation is as effective at generating the illusion of variety as full colour variation. We then evaluated the effectiveness of four variation methods that varied only salient parts of the characters. We found that head accessories, top texture and face texture variation are all equally effective at creating variety, whereas facial geometry alterations are less so.

This paper proposes simple, unconditionally stable, fully Eulerian integration schemes with no numerical viscosity that are capable of maintaining the liveliness of fluid motion without recourse to corrective devices. Pressure and fluxes are solved efficiently and simultaneously in a time-reversible manner on simplicial grids, and the energy is preserved exactly over long time scales in the case of inviscid fluids.

However, optical systems are inherently bulky while most capacitive systems are only practical in small form factors and are limited in their application since they respond only to human touch and are insensitive to variations in pressure [Westerman 1999].

IFSR sensors can acquire high-quality anti-aliased pressure images at high frame rates. They can be paper-thin, flexible, and transparent and can easily be scaled to fit on a portable device or to cover an entire table, floor or wall. The UnMousePad can sense three orders of magnitude of pressure variation, and can be used to distinguish multiple fingertip touches while simultaneously tracking pens and styli with a positional accuracy of 87 dpi, and can sense the pressure distributions of objects placed on its surface. In addition to supporting multi-touch interaction, IFSR is a general pressure imaging technology that can be incorporated into shoes, tennis racquets, hospital beds, factory assembly lines and many other applications.

        "abstract": "Content aware resizing gained popularity lately and users can now choose from a battery of methods to retarget their media. However, no single retargeting operator performs well on all images and all target sizes. In a user study we conducted, we found that users prefer to combine seam carving with cropping and scaling to produce results they are satisfied with. This inspires us to propose an algorithm that combines different operators in an optimal manner. We define a resizing space as a conceptual multi-dimensional space combining several resizing operators, and show how a path in this space defines a sequence of operations to retarget media. We define a new image similarity measure, which we term Bi-Directional Warping (BDW), and use it with a dynamic programming algorithm to find an optimal path in the resizing space. In addition, we show a simple and intuitive user interface allowing users to explore the resizing space of various image sizes interactively. Using key-frames and interpolation we also extend our technique to retarget video, providing the flexibility to use the best combination of operators at different times in the sequence.  images and video. Recently, content aware methods such as seam carving and non-uniform warping were proposed to supplement content oblivious methods such as scaling or cropping. A content aware retargeting operator relies on an importance map to preserve the important parts of the media at the expense of the less-important ones. Importance measures include image gradients, saliency and entropy, as well as high level cues such as face detectors, motion detectors and more. However, content aware methods do not succeed in all cases and for all sizes. For example, in case the important object occupies large portions of the image or video frame, content aware resizing might distort it. Often, the best resizing method depends on the image itself: one method might work best on one image, while another on a different image. In such cases using a combination of several methods (operators) might achieve better results than any specific one alone (Figure 1). In this paper we propose to combine several operators together, instead of searching for the best operator that will work on all images. Our approach is supported by a user study we conducted that clearly shows that users prefer to use more than one operator to achieve better results.  ",

We use this property to enhance the shape depiction of 3D objects by locally warping the environment lighting around main surface features. Contrary to previous work, which require specific illumination, material characteristics and/or stylization choices, our approach enhances surface shape without impairing the desired appearance. Thanks to our novel local shape descriptor, salient surface features are explicitly extracted in a view-dependent fashion at various scales without the need of any pre-process. We demonstrate our system on a variety of rendering settings, using object materials ranging from diffuse to glossy, to mirror or refractive, with direct or global illumination, and providing styles that range from photorealistic to non-photorealistic. The warping itself is very fast to compute on modern graphics hardware, enabling real-time performance in direct illumination scenarios. ",

The top row shows single scatter surface caustics in glass and water. The bottom row shows complex volumetric refractive caustics in amber and glass. All images were generated using the method in this paper, except the bottom right which used the common straight-line approximation that neglects shadow ray refraction. Abstract Light scattering in refractive media is an important optical phenomenon for computer graphics. While recent research has focused on multiple scattering, there has been less work on accurate solutions for single or low-order scattering. Refraction through a complex boundary allows a single external source to be visible in multiple directions internally with different strengths; these are hard to find with existing techniques. This paper presents techniques to quickly find paths that connect points inside and outside a medium while obeying the laws of refraction. We introduce: a half-vector based formulation to support the most common geometric representation, triangles with interpolated normals; hierarchical pruning to scale to triangular meshes; and, both a solver with strong accuracy guarantees, and a faster method that is empirically accurate. A GPU version achieves interactive frame rates in several examples.",

Our approach is based on a hybrid optimization method which combines an efficient derivative-aware spacetime constraints optimization with a derivative-free approach able to find non-local solutions in high-dimensional discontinuous spaces.

Our method builds upon scattered data sampling and interpolation on the GPU. We start with raytraced shading points and partition them into coherent shading clusters using adaptive seeding followed by k-means. At each cluster center we apply final gather to evaluate its incident irradiance using GPU-based photon mapping. We approximate the entire photon tree as a compact illumination cut, thus reducing the final gather cost for each ray. The sampled irradiance values are then interpolated at all shading points to produce rendering. Our method exploits the spatial coherence of illumination to reduce sampling cost. We sample sparsely and the distribution of sample points conforms with the underlying illumination changes. Therefore our method is both fast and preserves high rendering quality. Although the same property has been exploited by previous caching and adaptive sampling methods, these methods typically require sequential computation of sample points, making them ill-suited for the GPU. In contrast, we select sample points adaptively in a single pass, enabling parallel computation. As a result, our algorithm runs entirely on the GPU, achieving interactive rates for scenes with complex illumination effects. ",

Finally, we compute a discrete tangent vector field from the synthesized hair at every level of the hierarchy to remove undesired inconsistencies among hair trajectories. Improved hair trajectories can be extracted from the vector field.

For genus 0 and 1 (spheres and tori) it is well known how to generate and present regular maps, the Platonic solids are a familiar example. We present a method for the generation of space models of regular maps for genus 2 and higher. The method is based on a generalization of the method for tori. Shapes with the proper genus are derived from regular maps by tubification: edges are replaced by tubes. Tessellations are produced using group theory and hyperbolic geometry. The main results are a generic procedure to produce such tilings, and a collection of intriguing shapes and images. Furthermore, we show how to produce shapes of genus 2 and higher with a highly regular structure.  The first puzzle is trivial: We get a cube, blown up to a sphere, which is an example of a regular map. A cube is 246 = 48-fold symmetric, since each triangle shown in Figure 1 can be mapped to another one by rotation and turning the surface inside-out. We require for all solutions that they have such a 2pF -fold symmetry.

We stitch the new, topologically simplified portion of the mesh to the rest of the mesh at the cell boundaries. Our method detects and treats topological events with an emphasis on the preservation of detailed features, while simultaneously simplifying those portions of the material that are not visible.

Our process starts with measuring deformation properties of base materials. For each base material we acquire a set of example deformations, and we represent the material as a non-linear stress-strain relationship in a finite-element model. We have validated our material measurement process by comparing simulations of arbitrary stacks of base materials with measured deformations of fabricated material stacks. After material measurement, our process continues with designing stacked layers of base materials. We introduce an optimization process that finds the best combination of stacked layers that meets a user's criteria specified by example deformations. Our algorithm employs a number of strategies to prune poor solutions from the combinatorial search space. We demonstrate the complete process by designing and fabricating objects with complex heterogeneous materials using modern multi-material 3D printers. ",

We consider local similarity, i.e., each local neighborhood of the newly created object must match some local neighborhood of the exemplar. We show that we can find explicit shape modification rules that guarantee strict local similarity by looking at the structure of the partial symmetries of the object. By cutting the object into pieces along curves within symmetric areas, we can build shape operations that maintain local similarity by construction. We systematically collect such editing operations and analyze their dependency to build a shape grammar. We discuss how to extract general rewriting systems, context free hierarchical rules, and grid-based rules. All of this information is derived directly from the model, without user interaction. The extracted rules are then used to implement tools for semi-automatic shape modeling by example, which are demonstrated on a number of different example data sets. Overall, our paper provides a concise theoretical and practical framework for inverse procedural modeling of 3D objects.",

A user annotates an image by marking a number of image space constraints including planar regions of the scene, straight lines, and associated vanishing points.

Our system optimizes the warp such that straight lines remain straight, planar regions transform according to a homography, and the entire mapping is as shape-preserving as possible.

Owing to its geometric non-linearity, though, it does not suffer from the usual linearization artifacts. A material model with standard elastic moduli (Lam parameters) falls out naturally, and a minimizer for static problems is easily augmented to construct a fully variational 2nd order time integrator. It has excellent conservation properties even for very coarse simulations, making it very robust. Our analysis was motivated by a number of heuristic, physics-like algorithms from geometry processing (editing, morphing, parameterization, and simulation). Starting with a continuous energy formulation and taking the underlying geometry into account, we simplify and accelerate these algorithms while avoiding common pitfalls. Through the connection with the Biot strain of mechanics, the intuition of previous work that these ideas are \"like\" elasticity is shown to be spot on.  ",

In this paper, we present a technique for creating camouflage images. To foil the feature search, we remove the original subtle texture details of the hidden figures and replace them by that of the surrounding apparent image. To leave an appropriate degree of clues for the conjunction search, we compute and assign new tones to regions in the embedded figures by performing an optimization between two conflicting terms, which we call immersion and standout, corresponding to hiding and leaving clues, respectively.

These narratives are characterized for being compact, coherent and interactive, as inspired by principles of sequential art. Narratives depict the motion of one or several actors over time. Creating compact narratives is challenging as it is desired to combine the video frames in a way that reuses redundant backgrounds and depicts the stages of a motion. In addition, previous approaches focus on the generation of static summaries and can afford expensive image composition techniques. A dynamic narrative, on the other hand, must be played and skimmed in real-time, which imposes certain cost limitations in the video processing. In this paper, we define a novel process to compose foreground and background regions of video frames in a single interactive image using a series of spatio-temporal masks. These masks are created to improve the output of automatic video processing techniques such as image stitching and foreground segmentation. Unlike hand-drawn narratives, often limited to static representations, the proposed system allows users to explore the narrative dynamically and produce different representations of motion. We have built an authoring system that incorporates these methods and demonstrated successful results on a number of video clips. The authoring system can be used to create interactive posters of video clips, browse video in a compact manner or highlight a motion sequence in a movie. ",

These cameras extend DOF by deblurring a captured image with a single spatially-invariant PSF. For these cameras, the quality of recovered images depends both on the magnitude of the PSF spectrum (MTF) of the camera, and the similarity between PSFs at different depths. While researchers have compared the MTFs of different extended DOF cameras, relatively little attention has been paid to evaluating their depth invariances. In this paper, we compare the depth invariance of several cameras, and introduce a new camera that improves in this regard over existing designs, while still maintaining a good MTF. Our technique utilizes a novel optical element placed in the pupil plane of an imaging system. Whereas previous approaches use optical elements characterized by their amplitude or phase profile, our approach utilizes one whose behavior is characterized by its scattering properties. Such an element is commonly referred to as an optical diffuser, and thus we refer to our new approach as diffusion coding. We show that diffusion coding can be analyzed in a simple and intuitive way by modeling the effect of a diffuser as a kernel in light field space. We provide detailed analysis of diffusion coded cameras and show results from an implementation using a custom designed diffuser. ",

The first acquires representatives of high angular dimension but sampled sparsely over the surface, while the second acquires keys of low angular dimension but sampled densely over the surface. We develop a hand-held, high-speed BRDF capturing device for phase one measurements. A condenser-based optical setup collects a dense hemisphere of rays emanating from a single point on the target sample as it is manually scanned over it, yielding 10 BRDF point measurements per second. Lighting directions from 6 LEDs are applied at each measurement; these are amplified to a full 4D BRDF using the general (NDF-tabulated) microfacet model. The second phase captures N=20-200 images of the entire sample from a fixed view and lit by a varying area source. We show that the resulting N-dimensional keys capture much of the distance information in the original BRDF space, so that they effectively discriminate among representatives, though they lack sufficient angular detail to reconstruct the SVBRDF by themselves. At each surface position, a local linear combination of a small number of neighboring representatives is computed to match each key, yielding a highresolution SVBRDF.

A key problem is the approximation of the design surface by a union of patches, socalled panels, that can be manufactured with a selected technology at reasonable cost, while meeting the design intent and achieving the desired aesthetic quality of panel layout and surface smoothness. The production of curved panels is mostly based on molds. Since the cost of mold fabrication often dominates the panel cost, there is strong incentive to use the same mold for multiple panels. We cast the major practical requirements for architectural surface paneling, including mold reuse, into a global optimization framework that interleaves discrete and continuous optimization steps to minimize production cost while meeting user-specified quality constraints. The search space for optimization is mainly generated through controlled deviation from the design surface and tolerances on positional and normal continuity between neighboring panels. A novel 6-dimensional metric space allows us to quickly compute approximate inter-panel distances, which dramatically improves the performance of the optimization and enables the handling of complex arrangements with thousands of panels. The practical relevance of our system is demonstrated by paneling solutions for real, cutting-edge architectural freeform design projects. ",

A key component of our algorithm is a BVH (bounding volume hierarchy) based on 4D hyper-trapezoids that project into 3D OBBs (oriented bounding boxes) in spatial dimensions. This acceleration structure is able to provide tight bounding volumes for scene geometries, and is thus efficient in pruning intersection tests during ray traversal. More importantly, it can exploit the natural coherence on the time dimension in motion blurred scenes. The structure can be quickly constructed by utilizing the micropolygon grids generated during micropolygon tessellation. Ray tracing of defocused and motion blurred scenes is efficiently performed by traversing the structure. Both the BVH construction and ray traversal are easily implemented on GPUs and integrated into a GPU-based micropolygon renderer. In our experiments, our ray tracer performs up to an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-art rasterizers while consistently delivering an image quality equivalent to a maximumquality rasterizer. We also demonstrate that the ray tracing algorithm can be extended to handle a variety of effects, such as secondary ray effects and transparency. ",

While fluorescent materials are common in everyday life, they have received little attention in computer graphics. Especially, no bidirectional reradiation measurements of fluorescent materials have been available so far. In this paper, we extend the well-known concept of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) to account for energy transfer between wavelengths, resulting in a Bispectral Bidirectional Reflectance and Reradiation Distribution Function (bispectral BRRDF). Using a bidirectional and bispectral measurement setup, we acquire reflectance and reradiation data of a variety of fluorescent materials, including vehicle paints, paper and fabric, and compare their renderings with RGB, RGBRGB, and spectral BRDFs. Our acquisition is guided by a principal component analysis on complete bispectral data taken under a sparse set of angles. We show that in order to faithfully reproduce the full bispectral information for all other angles, only a very small number of wavelength pairs needs to be measured at a high angular resolution. ",

We present two interaction techniques based on this idea and describe their implementation. The first technique is explicit layer swap. The user clicks the target layer, and the system swaps the layer with the one directly underneath it. The second technique is layer-aware dragging. As the user drags the object, the system adjusts its depth automatically to pass over or under a colliding object in the screen space, according to user control. Although the user interface is 2.5D, all scene representations are true 3D, and thus the system naturally supports local layering, self-occlusions, and folds. Internally, the system dynamically computes the apparent layer structure in the current configuration and makes appropriate depth adjustments to obtain the desired results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in cloth and rope manipulation systems. ",

Many systems allow for anisotropic scattering, in the sense that scattered intensity depends on the scattering angle, but the standard equation assumes that the structure of the medium is isotropic. This limitation impedes physics-based rendering of volume models of cloth, hair, skin, and other important volumetric or translucent materials that do have anisotropic structure. This paper presents an end-to-end formulation of physics-based volume rendering of anisotropic scattering structures, allowing these materials to become full participants in global illumination simulations. We begin with a generalized radiative transfer equation, derived from scattering by oriented non-spherical particles. Within this framework, we propose a new volume scattering model analogous to the well-known family of microfacet surface reflection models; we derive an anisotropic diffusion approximation, including the weak form required for finite element solution and a way to compute the diffusion matrix from the parameters of the scattering model; and we also derive a new anisotropic dipole BSSRDF for anisotropic translucent materials. We demonstrate results from Monte Carlo, finite element, and dipole simulations. All these contributions are readily implemented in existing rendering systems for volumes and translucent materials, and they all reduce to the standard practice in the isotropic case.",

Finding so many contacts in densely interlinked geometry is a pathological case for traditional collision detection, and the sheer number of contact interactions makes contact processing the simulation bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a method for approximating penalty-based contact forces in yarn-yarn collisions by computing the exact contact response at one time step, then using a rotated linear force model to approximate forces in nearby deformed configurations. Because contacts internal to the cloth exhibit good temporal coherence, sufficient accuracy can be obtained with infrequent updates to the approximation, which are done adaptively in space and time. Furthermore, by tracking contact models we reduce the time to detect new contacts. The end result is a 7to 9-fold speedup in contact processing and a 4to 5-fold overall speedup, enabling simulation of character-scale garments.",

An objective function is formulated as a Conditional Random Field model, with terms assessing the consistency of faces with labels, and terms between labels of neighboring faces. The objective function is learned from a collection of labeled training meshes. The algorithm uses hundreds of geometric and contextual label features and learns different types of segmentations for different tasks, without requiring manual parameter tuning. Our algorithm achieves a significant improvement in results over the state-of-the-art when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark, often producing segmentations and labelings comparable to those produced by humans.  tasks in geometric modeling, manufacturing, animation and texturing of 3D meshes rely on their segmentation into parts. Many of these problems further require labeled segmentations, where the parts are also recognized as instances of known part types. For most of these applications, the segmentation and labeling of the input shape is manually specified. For example, to synthesize texture for a humanoid mesh, one must identify which parts should have \"arm\" texture, which should have \"leg\" texture, and so on. Even tasks such as 3D shape matching or retrieval, which do not directly require labeled-segmentations, could benefit from knowledge of constituent parts and labels. However, there has been very little research in part labeling for 3D meshes, and 3D object segmentation likewise remains an open research problem [Chen et al. 2009].  ",

We investigate two design tasks: precise adjustment and artistic exploration. We collect objective and subjective data, finding that subjects can perform equally well with physical and perceptual sliders as long as the interface responds interactively.

Abstract Rendering applications in design, manufacturing, ecommerce and other fields are used to simulate the appearance of objects and scenes. Fidelity with respect to appearance is often critical, and calculating global illumination (GI) is an important contributor to image fidelity; but it is expensive to compute. GI approximation methods, such as virtual point light (VPL) algorithms, are efficient, but they can induce image artifacts and distortions of object appearance. In this paper we systematically study the perceptual effects on image quality and material appearance of global illumination approximations made by VPL algorithms. In a series of psy-chophysical experiments we investigate the relationships between rendering parameters, object properties and image fidelity in a VPL renderer. Using the results of these experiments we analyze how VPL counts and energy clamping levels affect the visibility of image artifacts and distortions of material appearance, and show how object geometry and material properties modulate these effects. We find the ranges of these parameters that produce VPL renderings that are visually equivalent to reference renderings. Further we identify classes of shapes and materials that cannot be accurately rendered using VPL methods with limited resources. Using these findings we propose simple heuristics to guide visually equivalent and efficient rendering, and present a method for correcting energy losses in VPL renderings. This work provides a strong perceptual foundation for a popular and efficient class of GI algorithms.",

Such operations are highly important for a variety of issues arising from the production, live broadcast, and consumption of 3D content. Our work is motivated by the observation that the displayed depth and the resulting 3D viewing experience are dictated by a complex combination of perceptual, technological, and artistic constraints. We first discuss the most important perceptual aspects of stereo vision and their implications for stereoscopic content creation. We then formalize these insights into a set of basic disparity mapping operators. These operators enable us to control and retarget the depth of a stereoscopic scene in a nonlinear and locally adaptive fashion. To implement our operators, we propose a new strategy based on stereoscopic warping of the input video streams. From a sparse set of stereo correspondences, our algorithm computes disparity and image-based saliency estimates, and uses them to compute a deformation of the input views so as to meet the target disparities. Our approach represents a practical solution for actual stereo production and display that does not require camera calibration, accurate dense depth maps, occlusion handling, or inpainting. We demonstrate the performance and versatility of our method using examples from live action postproduction, 3D display size adaptation, and live broadcast. An additional user study and ground truth comparison further provide evidence for the quality and practical relevance of the presented work. ",

These constructions characterize the space of symmetric correspondences between points  i.e., orbits. A key observation is that a set of points in the same orbit appears as a clique in a correspondence graph induced by pairwise similarities. As a result, the problem of finding approximate and partial symmetries in a point set reduces to the problem of measuring connectedness in the correspondence graph, a well-studied problem for which spectral methods provide a robust solution.

Sampling-based techniques are well suited to this task because of their lack of dependence on derivatives, which are difficult to estimate in contact-rich scenarios. They are also easy to parallelize, which we exploit in our implementation on a compute cluster.

A number of recent algorithms for conversion of arbitrary meshes to regularly sampled form (typically quadrangulation) aim to align the resulting mesh with feature lines of the geometry. While resulting in a substantial improvement in mesh quality, feature alignment makes it difficult to obtain coarse regular patch partitions of the mesh. In this paper, we propose an approach to constructing patch layouts consisting of small numbers of quadrilateral patches while maintaining good feature alignment. To achieve this, we use quadrilateral T-meshes, for which the intersection of two faces may not be the whole edge or vertex, but a part of an edge. T-meshes offer more flexibility for reduction of the number of patches and vertices in a base domain while maintaining alignment with geometric features. At the same time, T-meshes retain many desirable features of quadrangulations, allowing construction of high-order representations, easy packing of regularly sampled geometric data into textures, as well as supporting different types of discretizations for physical simulation.  2. Approximation: Each patch should approximate the original mesh well. 3. Mesh complexity: The domain mesh should have as few vertices as possible, while satisfying other constraints. 4. Orientation and Alignment: In areas with well-pronounced consistent curvature directions, patch parametric lines should follow the curvature; patch boundaries should be aligned with sharp features and smooth surface boundaries. Existing techniques offer a tradeoff between alignment with features and isometry and the number of patches in the domain mesh. Techniques allowing to keep the number of patches small have only restricted forms of alignment control, while many recent algorithms with good alignment control often yield a larger number of patches in the domain mesh.

SmartBoxes are assembled through a discrete optimization to balance between two snapping forces defined respectively by a data-fitting term and a contextual term, which together assist the user in reconstructing the architectural model from a sparse and noisy point cloud.

Our simulations display similar effects by proposing an optic flow-based approach for steering walkers inspired by cognitive science work on human locomotion. Compared to previous approaches, our model improves such an emergence as well as the global efficiency of walkers traffic. We thus enhance the overall believability of animations by avoiding improbable locking situations. Abstract In the everyday exercise of controlling their locomotion, humans rely on their optic flow of the perceived environment to achieve collision-free navigation. In crowds, in spite of the complexity of the environment made of numerous obstacles, humans demonstrate remarkable capacities in avoiding collisions. Cognitive science work on human locomotion states that relatively succinct information is extracted from the optic flow to achieve safe locomotion. In this paper, we explore a novel vision-based approach of collision avoidance between walkers that fits the requirements of interactive crowd simulation. By simulating humans based on cognitive science results, we detect future collisions as well as the level of danger from visual stimuli. The motor-response is twofold: a reorientation strategy prevents future collision, whereas a deceleration strategy prevents imminent collisions. Several examples of our simulation results show that the emergence of self-organized patterns of walkers is reinforced using our approach. The emergent phenomena are visually appealing. More importantly, they improve the overall efficiency of the walkers traffic and avoid improbable locking situations.",

For applications that need lighting adjustments to the rendered images, editing environment maps directly is still cumbersome.

Second, determining the parameters of image-editing operations needed to achieve specific changes to the selected lighting feature requires extensive trial-and-error. This paper presents envyLight, an interactive interface for editing natural illumination that combines an algorithm to select environment map regions, by sketching strokes on lighting features in the rendered image, with a small set of editing operations to quickly adjust the selected feature. The envyLight selection algorithm works well for indoor and outdoor lighting corresponding to rendered images where lighting features vary widely in number, size, contrast and edge blur. Furthermore, envyLight selection is general with respect to material type, from matte to sharp glossy, and the complexity of scenes' shapes. envyLight editing operations allow designers to quickly alter the position, contrast and edge blur of the selected lighting feature and can be keyframed to support animation.

The LR is simulated and stored in the frequency domain, once per room in the scene. The ER accounts for more detailed spatial variation, by recording a set of peak delays/amplitudes in the time domain and a residual frequency response sampled in octave frequency bands, at each source/receiver point pair in a 5D grid. An efficient run-time uses this precomputed representation to perform binaural sound rendering based on frequency-domain convolution.

The outgoing radiance due to single scattering is determined by the integral of the product of the environment lighting, the scattering function, and the transmittance that accounts for selfshadowing among hair fibers. We approximate the environment light by a set of spherical radial basis functions (SRBFs) and thus convert the outgoing radiance integral into the sum of radiance contributions of all SRBF lights. For each SRBF light, we factor out the effective transmittance to represent the radiance integral as the product of two terms: the transmittance and the convolution of the SRBF light and the scattering function. Observing that the convolution term is independent of the hair geometry, we precompute it for commonly-used scattering models, and reduce the run-time computation to table lookups. We further propose a technique, called the convolution optical depth map, to efficiently approximate the effective transmittance by filtering the optical depth maps generated at the center of the SRBF using a depth-dependent kernel. As for the multiple scattering computation, we handle SRBF lights by using similar factorization and precomputation schemes, and adopt sparse sampling and interpolation to speed up the computation.

Shape regularity of surface patches, described in terms of orientation and contour conditions, was proposed long ago as a culling criterion for hierarchical self-collision detection.

Here we show how this concept can be used as the basis for a psychophysics of presence in VEs, the sensation of being in the place depicted by the virtual environment displays (Place Illusion, PI), and also the illusion that events occurring in the virtual environment are real (Plausibility Illusion, Psi). The new methodology involves matching experiments akin to those in color science. Twenty participants first experienced PI or Psi in the initial highest level immersive system, and then in 5 different trials chose transitions from lower to higher order systems and declared a match whenever they felt the same level of PI or Psi as they had in the initial system. In each transition they could change the type of illumination model used, or the field-of-view, or the display type (powerwall or HMD) or the extent of self-representation by an avatar. The results showed that the 10 participants instructed to choose transitions to attain a level of PI corresponding to that in the initial system tended to first choose a wide field-of-view and headmounted display, and then ensure that they had a virtual body that moved as they did. The other 10 in the Psi group concentrated far more on achieving a higher level of illumination realism, although having a virtual body representation was important for both groups.

But when applied to images taken from different sources or shot under different conditions, these techniques can produce unrealistic results. In this work, we present a framework that explicitly matches the visual appearance of images through a process we call image harmonization, before blending them. At the heart of this framework is a multi-scale technique that allows us to transfer the appearance of one image to another. We show that by carefully manipulating the scales of a pyramid decomposition of an image, we can match contrast, texture, noise, and blur, while avoiding image artifacts. The output composite can then be reconstructed from the modified pyramid coefficients while enforcing both alpha-based and seamless boundary constraints. We show how the proposed framework can be used to produce realistic composites with minimal user interaction in a number of different scenarios.",

Efficiency is obtained by evaluating the final radiance along a viewing ray directly from the lighting rays passing near to it, and by rapidly identifying such lighting rays in the scene. To facilitate the search for nearby lighting rays, we convert lighting rays and viewing rays into 6D points and planes according to their Plucker coordinates and coefficients, respectively. In this 6D line space, the problem of closest lines search becomes one of closest points to a plane query, which we significantly accelerate using a spatial hierarchy of the 6D points. This approach to lighting ray gathering supports complex light paths with multiple reflections and refractions, and avoids the use of a volume representation, which is expensive for large-scale scenes. This method also utilizes far fewer lighting rays than the number of photons needed in traditional volumetric photon mapping, and does not discretize viewing rays into numerous steps for ray marching. With this approach, results similar to volumetric photon mapping are obtained efficiently in terms of both storage and computation. ",

The surface wave simulation employs an unconditionally stable, symplectic time integration method that allows for a high propagation speed due to strong surface tension. Our approach can naturally separate the grid- and sub-grid scales based on a volume-preserving mean curvature flow. As our model for the sub-grid dynamics enforces a local conservation of mass, it leads to realistic pinch off and merging effects.

Compared to flowing cloth, such as loose dresses or capes, these types of garments involve nearly continuous collision contact and small wrinkles, that can be troublesome for traditional cloth simulation methods. Based on the observation that the wrinkles in closefitting clothing behave in a predominantly kinematic fashion, we have developed an example-based wrinkle synthesis technique. Our method drives wrinkle generation from the pose of the figure's kinematic skeleton. This approach allows high quality clothing wrinkles to be combined with a coarse cloth simulation that computes the global and dynamic aspects of the clothing motion. While the combined results do not exactly match a high-resolution reference simulation, they do capture many of the characteristic fine-scale features and wrinkles. Further, the combined system runs at interactive rates, making it suitable for applications where high-resolution offline simulations would not be a viable option. The wrinkle synthesis method uses a precomputed database built by simulating the high-resolution clothing as the articulated figure is moved over a range of poses. In principle, the space of poses is exponential in the total number of degrees of freedom; however clothing wrinkles are primarily affected by the nearest joints, allowing each joint to be processed independently. During synthesis, mesh interpolation is used to consider the influence of multiple joints, and combined with a coarse simulation to produce the final results at interactive rates. ",

Conformal maps are also orientation-preserving C diffeomorphisms, meaning they are extremely smooth and prevent unacceptable \"foldovers\" in the plane. Unfortunately, these maps are also notoriously difficult to control, so working with them in an interactive animation scenario to achieve specific effects is a significant challenge, sometimes even impossible. We describe a novel 2D shape deformation system which generates conformal maps, yet provides the user a large degree of control over the result. For example, it allows discontinuities at user-specified boundary points, so true bends can be introduced into the deformation. It also allows the prescription of angular constraints at corners of the target image. Combining these provides for a very effective user experience. At the heart of our method is a very natural differential shape representation for conformal maps, using so-called \"conformal factors\" and \"angular factors\", which allow more intuitive control compared to representation in the usual spatial domain. Beyond deforming a given shape into a new one at each key frame, our method also provides the ability to interpolate between shapes in a very natural way, such that also the intermediate deformations are conformal. Our method is extremely efficient: it requires only the solution of a small dense linear system at preprocess time and a matrix-vector multiplication during runtime (which can be implemented on a modern GPU), thus the deformations, even on extremely large images, may be performed in real-time.",

Representing the unlimited image content with the extremely limited shapes and restrictive placement of characters makes this problem challenging.

Anchor frames are automatically computed over one or even multiple performances. We introduce a robust image-space tracking method that computes pixel matches directly from the reference frame to all anchor frames, and thereby to the remaining frames in the sequence via sequential matching. This allows us to propagate one reconstructed frame to an entire sequence in parallel, in contrast to previous sequential methods. Our anchored reconstruction approach also limits tracker drift and robustly handles occlusions and motion blur. The parallel tracking and mesh propagation offer low computation times.

A common approach is to first compute reflectance and illumination intrinsic images. Reflectances can then be edited independently, and recomposed with the illumination. However, manipulating only the reflectance color does not account for diffuse interreflections, and can result in inconsistent shading in the edited image. We propose an approach for further decomposing illumination into direct lighting, and indirect diffuse illumination from each material. This decomposition allows us to change indirect illumination from an individual material independently, so it matches the modified reflectance color. To address the underconstrained problem of decomposing illumination into multiple components, we take advantage of its smooth nature, as well as user-provided constraints. We demonstrate our approach on a number of examples, where we consistently edit material colors and the associated interreflections. Links: DL PDF WEB ",

By filtering operations based on either their type or which vertices they affect, MeshFlow also ensures that viewers can interactively focus on the relevant parts of the modeling process. Automatically generated graphical annotations visualize the clustered operations.

To our knowledge this is the first provably correct algorithm with time and space dependent only on the number of points produced. Our method has two phases, both based on classical dartthrowing. The first phase uses a background grid of square cells to rapidly create an unbiased, near-maximal covering of the domain. The second phase completes the maximal covering by calculating the connected components of the remaining uncovered voids, and by using their geometry to efficiently place unbiased samples that cover them. The second phase converges quickly, overcoming a common difficulty in dart-throwing methods. The deterministic memory is O(n) and the expected running time is O(n log n), where n is the output size, the number of points in the final sample. Our serial implementation verifies that the log n dependence is minor, and nearly O(n) performance for both time and memory is achieved in practice.

These fluctuations are typically caused by the camera's automatic adjustment of its tonal settings while shooting. Our approach operates on a continuous video shot by first designating one or more frames as anchors. We then tonally align a sequence of frames with each anchor: for each frame, we compute an adjustment map that indicates how each of its pixels should be modified in order to appear as if it was captured with the tonal settings of the anchor. The adjustment map is efficiently updated between successive frames by taking advantage of temporal video coherence and the global nature of the tonal fluctuations. Once a sequence has been aligned, it is possible to generate smooth tonal transitions between anchors, and also further control its tonal characteristics in a consistent and principled manner, which is difficult to do without incurring strong artifacts when operating on unstable sequences. We demonstrate the utility of our method using a number of clips captured with a variety of video cameras, and believe that it is well-suited for integration into today's non-linear video editing tools.

Often considered a degrading artifact, it has become a crucial component for realistic imagery and an artistic means that can even lead to an increased perceived brightness. So far, only costly offline processes allowed for convincing simulations of the complex light interactions. In this paper, we present a novel method to interactively compute physically-plausible flare renderings for photographic lenses. The underlying model covers many components that are important for realism, such as imperfections, chromatic and geometric lens aberrations, and antireflective lens coatings. Various acceleration strategies allow for a perfor-mance/quality tradeoff, making our technique applicable both in real-time applications and in high-quality production rendering.

Unfortunately, linear blending schemes for skeletons or cages are not always easy to use because they may require manual weight painting or modeling closed polyhedral envelopes around objects. Our goal is to make the design and control of deformations simpler by allowing the user to work freely with the most convenient combination of handle types. We develop linear blending weights that produce smooth and intuitive deformations for points, bones and cages of arbitrary topology. Our weights, called bounded biharmonic weights, minimize the Laplacian energy subject to bound constraints. Doing so spreads the influences of the controls in a shape-aware and localized manner, even for objects with complex and concave boundaries. The variational weight optimization also makes it possible to customize the weights so that they preserve the shape of specified essential object features. We demonstrate successful use of our blending weights for real-time deformation of 2D and 3D shapes. ",

Used in this context, the cross dissolve produces a very strong motion effect; a key contribution of the paper is to explain this effect and analyze its operating range. The approach operates by creating a graph with faces as nodes, and similarities as edges, and solving for walks and shortest paths on this graph. The processing pipeline involves face detection, locating fiducials (eyes/nose/mouth), solving for pose, warping to frontal views, and image comparison based on Local Binary Patterns.

Our approach is based on the observation that efficient methods exist to search for nearly isometric maps (e.g., Mobius Voting or Heat Kernel Maps), but no single solution found with these methods provides low-distortion everywhere for pairs of surfaces differing by large deformations. To address this problem, we suggest using a weighted combination of these maps to produce a \"blended map.\" This approach enables algorithms that leverage efficient search procedures, yet can provide the flexibility to handle large deformations. The main challenges of this approach lie in finding a set of candidate maps {mi} and their associated blending weights {bi(p)} for every point p on the surface. We address these challenges specifically for conformal maps by making the following contributions. First, we provide a way to blend maps, defining the image of p as the weighted geodesic centroid of mi(p). Second, we provide a definition for smooth blending weights at every point p that are proportional to the area preservation of mi at p. Third, we solve a global optimization problem that selects candidate maps based both on their area preservation and consistency with other selected maps. During experiments with these methods, we find that our algorithm produces blended maps that align semantic features better than alternative approaches over a variety of data sets. ",

At intermediate light levels vision is mesopic with both the rods and cones active. Although the rods have a spectral response distinct from the cones, they still share the same neural pathways. As light levels decrease and the rods become increasingly active they cause a perceived shift in color. We model this process so that we can compute perceived colors for mesopic and scotopic scenes from spectral image data. We also describe how the effect can be approximated from standard high dynamic range RGB images. Once we have determined rod and cone responses, we map them to RGB values that can be displayed on a standard monitor to elicit the intended color perception when viewed photopically. Our method focuses on computing the color shift associated with low-light conditions and leverages current HDR techniques to control the images dynamic range.

In the original image, pixels are represented on a square pixel lattice, where diagonal neighbors are only connected through a single point. This causes thin features to become visually disconnected under magnification by conventional means, and creates ambiguities in the connectedness and separation of diagonal neighbors. The key to our algorithm is in resolving these ambiguities. This enables us to reshape the pixel cells so that neighboring pixels belonging to the same feature are connected through edges, thereby preserving the feature connectivity under magnification. We reduce pixel aliasing artifacts and improve smoothness by fitting spline curves to contours in the image and optimizing their control points. ",

As the user draws, ShadowDraw dynamically updates a shadow image underlying the users strokes. The shadows are suggestive of object contours that guide the user as they continue drawing. This paradigm is similar to tracing, with two major differences. First, we do not provide a single image from which the user can trace; rather ShadowDraw automatically blends relevant images from a large database to construct the shadows. Second, the system dynamically adapts to the users drawings in real-time and produces suggestions accordingly. ShadowDraw works by efficiently matching local edge patches between the query, constructed from the current drawing, and a database of images. A hashing technique enforces both local and global similarity and provides sufficient speed for interactive feedback. Shadows are created by aggregating the edge maps from the best database matches, spatially weighted by their match scores.

Simulation and collision processing can share the same uniform grid, making the algorithm easy to parallelize. We demonstrate an implementation of all the steps of the algorithm on the GPU.

Previous work most commonly employs barycentric or circumcentric duals; while barycentric duals guarantee that the dual of each simplex lies within the simplex, circumcentric duals are often preferred due to the induced orthogonality between primal and dual complexes. We instead promote the use of weighted duals (\"power diagrams\"). They allow greater flexibility in the location of dual vertices while keeping primal-dual orthogonality, thus providing a valuable extension to the usual choices of dual by only adding one additional scalar per primal vertex. Furthermore, we introduce a family of functionals on pairs of complexes that we derive from bounds on the errors induced by diagonal Hodge stars, commonly used in discrete computations. The minimizers of these functionals, called HOT meshes, are shown to be generalizations of Centroidal Voronoi Tesselations and Optimal Delaunay Triangulations, and to provide increased accuracy and flexibility for a variety of computational purposes.

This additional information adds substantially to traditional particle methods. First, particles can be represented by anisotropic shapes such as ellipsoids, which approximate surfaces more accurately than spheres. Second, shape matching becomes robust for sparse structures such as chains of particles or even single particles because the undefined degrees of freedom are captured in the rotational states of the particles.

While this gives users more choice for shape selection, it can be difficult to explore large collections and understand the range of variations amongst the shapes. Exploration is particularly challenging for public shape repositories, which are often only loosely tagged and contain neither point-based nor part-based correspondences. In this paper, we present a method for discovering and exploring continuous variability in a collection of 3D shapes without correspondences. Our method is based on a novel navigation interface that allows users to explore a collection of related shapes by deforming a base template shape through a set of intuitive deformation controls. We also help the user to select the most meaningful deformations using a novel technique for learning shape variability in terms of deformations of the template. Our technique assumes that the set of shapes lies near a low-dimensional manifold in a certain descriptor space, which allows us to avoid establishing correspondences between shapes, while being rotation and scaling invariant.

Our approach produces high-quality results, without degrading edges or introducing halos, even at extreme settings. Our approach builds upon standard image pyramids and enables a broad range of effects via simple point-wise nonlinearities (shown in corners). For an example image (a), we show results of tone mapping using our method, creating a natural rendition (b) and a more exaggerated look that enhances details as well (c). Laplacian pyramids have previously been considered unsuitable for such tasks, but our approach shows otherwise. Abstract The Laplacian pyramid is ubiquitous for decomposing images into multiple scales and is widely used for image analysis. However, because it is constructed with spatially invariant Gaussian kernels, the Laplacian pyramid is widely believed as being unable to represent edges well and as being ill-suited for edge-aware operations such as edge-preserving smoothing and tone mapping. To tackle these tasks, a wealth of alternative techniques and representations have been proposed, e.g., anisotropic diffusion, neighborhood filtering, and specialized wavelet bases. While these methods have demonstrated successful results, they come at the price of additional complexity, often accompanied by higher computational cost or the need to post-process the generated results. In this paper, we show state-of-the-art edge-aware processing using standard Laplacian pyramids. We characterize edges with a simple threshold on pixel values that allows us to differentiate large-scale edges from small-scale details. Building upon this result, we propose a set of image filters to achieve edge-preserving smoothing, detail enhancement, tone mapping, and inverse tone mapping. The advantage of our approach is its simplicity and flexibility, relying only on simple point-wise nonlinearities and small Gaussian convolutions; no optimization or post-processing is required. As we demonstrate, our method produces consistently high-quality results, without degrading edges or introducing halos.",

Our method captures video of a flat target surface from a fixed video camera lit by a hand-held, moving, linear light source. After processing, we obtain an SVBRDF. We introduce a BRDF chart, analogous to a color \"checker\" chart, which arranges a set of known-BRDF reference tiles over a small card. A sequence of light responses from the chart tiles as well as from points on the target is captured and matched to reconstruct the target's appearance. We develop a new algorithm for BRDF reconstruction which works directly on these LDR responses, without knowing the light or camera position, or acquiring HDR lighting. It compensates for spatial variation caused by the local (finite distance) camera and light position by warping responses over time to align them to a specular reference. After alignment, we find an optimal linear combination of the Lambertian and purely specular reference responses to match each target point's response. The same weights are then applied to the corresponding (known) reference BRDFs to reconstruct the target point's BRDF. We extend the basic algorithm to also recover varying surface normals by adding two spherical caps for diffuse and specular references to the BRDF chart. We demonstrate convincing results obtained after less than 30 seconds of data capture, using commercial mobile phone cameras in a casual environment. ",

In contrast to fixed color primaries (e.g. RGB or CMY), which cannot provide optimal image quality for all scene conditions, our camera with switchable primaries provides optimal color fidelity and signal to noise ratio for multiple scene conditions. Next, we show that the same concept can be used to layer two RGB CFAs to design a camera with switchable low dynamic range (LDR) and high dynamic range (HDR) modes. Further, we show that such layering can be generalized as a constrained satisfaction problem (CSP) allowing to constrain a large number of parameters (e.g. different operational modes, amount and direction of the shifts, placement of the primaries in the CFA) to provide an optimal solution. We investigate practical design options for shiftable layering of the CFAs. We demonstrate these by building prototype cameras for both switchable primaries and switchable LDR/HDR modes. To the best of our knowledge, we present, for the first time, the concept of shiftable layers of CFAs that provides a new degree of freedom in photography where multiple operational modes are available to the user in a single camera for optimizing the picture quality based on the nature of the scene geometry, color and illumination.",

Strokes painted in the 2D viewport window must be embedded in 3D space in a way that gives creative freedom to the artist while maintaining an acceptable level of controllability. We address this challenge by proposing a canvas concept defined implicitly by a 3D scalar field. The artist shapes the implicit canvas by creating approximate 3D proxy geometry. An optimization procedure is then used to embed painted strokes in space by satisfying different objective criteria defined on the scalar field. This functionality allows us to implement tools for painting along level set surfaces or across different level sets. Our method gives the power of fine-tuning the implicit canvas to the artist using a unified painting/sculpting metaphor. A sculpting tool can be used to paint into the implicit canvas. Rather than adding color, this tool creates a local change in the scalar field that results in outward or inward protrusions along the field's gradient direction. We address a visibility ambiguity inherent in 3D stroke rendering with a depth offsetting method that is well suited for hardware acceleration.

Outward-looking cameras are attached to the limbs of the subject, and the joint angles and root pose are estimated through non-linear optimization.

Structure-from-motion is used to estimate the skeleton structure and to provide initialization for the non-linear optimization procedure.

Here, we render pairs of original and deformed motion trajectories in red and blue. Making the relative transformation of such pathlines consistent ensures temporal coherence of the resized video. Abstract The key to high-quality video resizing is preserving the shape and motion of visually salient objects while remaining temporally-coherent. These spatial and temporal requirements are difficult to reconcile, typically leading existing video retargeting methods to sacrifice one of them and causing distortion or waving artifacts. Recent work enforces temporal coherence of content-aware video warping by solving a global optimization problem over the entire video cube. This significantly improves the results but does not scale well with the resolution and length of the input video and quickly becomes intractable. We propose a new method that solves the scalability problem without compromising the resizing quality. Our method factors the problem into spatial and time/motion components: we first resize each frame independently to preserve the shape of salient regions, and then we optimize their motion using a reduced model for each pathline of the optical flow. This factorization decomposes the optimization of the video cube into sets of subproblems whose size is proportional to a single frames resolution and which can be solved in parallel. We also show how to incorporate cropping into our optimization, which is useful for scenes with numerous salient objects where warping alone would degenerate to linear scaling. Our results match the quality of state-of-the-art retargeting methods while dramatically reducing the computation time and memory consumption, making content-aware video resiz-ing scalable and practical.",

We define a color and tone style as a set of explicit or implicit rules governing color and tone adjustments. Our goal in this paper is to learn implicit color and tone adjustment rules from examples. That is, given a set of examples, each of which is a pair of corresponding images before and after adjustments, we would like to discover the underlying mathematical relationships optimally connecting the color and tone of corresponding pixels in all image pairs. We formally define tone and color adjustment rules as mappings, and propose to approximate complicated spatially varying nonlinear mappings in a piecewise manner. The reason behind this is that a very complicated mapping can still be locally approximated with a low-order polynomial model. Parameters within such low-order models are trained using data extracted from example image pairs. We successfully apply our framework in two scenarios, low-quality photo enhancement by transferring the style of a high-end camera, and photo enhancement using styles learned from photographers and designers.

The user is recorded in a natural environment using a non-intrusive, commercially available 3D sensor. The simplicity of this acquisition device comes at the cost of high noise levels in the acquired data. To effectively map low-quality 2D images and 3D depth maps to realistic facial expressions, we introduce a novel face tracking algorithm that combines geometry and texture registration with pre-recorded animation priors in a single optimization. Formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation in a reduced parameter space, our method implicitly exploits temporal coherence to stabilize the tracking. We demonstrate that compelling 3D facial dynamics can be reconstructed in realtime without the use of face markers, intrusive lighting, or complex scanning hardware. This makes our system easy to deploy and facilitates a range of new applications, e.g. in digital gameplay or social interactions. ",

The efficacy of these applications often crucially depends upon the distribution quality of the underlying samples. While uniform sampling can be analyzed by using existing spatial and spectral methods, these cannot be easily extended to general non-uniform settings, such as adaptive, anisotropic, or non-Euclidean domains. We present new methods for analyzing non-uniform sample distributions. Our key insight is that standard Fourier analysis, which depends on samples' spatial locations, can be reformulated into an equivalent form that depends only on the distribution of their location differentials. We call this differential domain analysis. The main benefit of this reformulation is that it bridges the fundamental connection between the samples' spatial statistics and their spectral properties. In addition, it allows us to generalize our method with different computation kernels and differential measurements. Using this analysis, we can quantitatively measure the spatial and spectral properties of various non-uniform sample distributions, including adaptive, anisotropic, and non-Euclidean domains.  3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 frequency  uniform  3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 0  0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 |d|  ",

Such volumetric attenuators recreate a 4D light field or highcontrast 2D image when illuminated by a uniform backlight. Since arbitrary oblique views may be inconsistent with any single attenuator, iterative tomographic reconstruction minimizes the difference between the emitted and target light fields, subject to physical constraints on attenuation. As multi-layer generalizations of conventional parallax barriers, such displays are shown, both by theory and experiment, to exceed the performance of existing dual-layer architectures. For 3D display, spatial resolution, depth of field, and brightness are increased, compared to parallax barriers. For a plane at a fixed depth, our optimization also allows optimal construction of high dynamic range displays, confirming existing heuristics and providing the first extension to multiple, disjoint layers. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits and limitations of attenuationbased light field displays using an inexpensive fabrication method: separating multiple printed transparencies with acrylic sheets.

That is, when the puzzle is assembled, all the pieces are notched except one single key component which remains mobile. The intriguing property of the assembled burr puzzle is that it is stable, perfectly interlocked, without glue or screws, etc. Moreover, a burr puzzle consisting of a small number of pieces is still rather difficult to solve since the assembly must follow certain orders while the combinatorial complexity of the puzzle's piece arrangements is extremely high. In this paper, we generalize the 6-piece orthogonal burr puzzle (a knot) to design and model burr puzzles from 3D models. Given a 3D input model, we first interactively embed a network of knots into the 3D shape. Our method automatically optimizes and arranges the orientation of each knot, and modifies pieces of adjacent knots with an appropriate connection type. Then, following the geometry of the embedded pieces, the entire 3D model is partitioned by splitting the solid while respecting the assembly motion of embedded pieces. The main technical challenge is to enforce the single-key property and ensure the assembly/disassembly remains feasible, as the puzzle pieces in a network of knots are highly interlocked. Lastly, we also present an automated approach to generate the visualizations of the puzzle assembly process. ",

We first capture a small database of multi-view video sequences of an actor performing various basic motions.

We then apply a marker-less model-based performance capture approach to the entire database to obtain pose and geometry of the actor in each database frame. To create novel video sequences of the actor from the database, a user animates a 3D human skeleton with novel motion and viewpoints. Our technique then synthesizes a realistic video sequence of the actor performing the specified motion based only on the initial database. The first key component of our approach is a new efficient retrieval strategy to find appropriate spatio-temporally coherent database frames from which to synthesize target video frames. The second key component is a warping-based texture synthesis approach that uses the retrieved most-similar database frames to synthesize spatio-temporally coherent target video frames. For instance, this enables us to easily create video sequences of actors performing dangerous stunts without them being placed in harms way.

Our method leverages the rich source of photographs for creative 3D modeling. However, with only a photo as a guide, creating a 3D model from scratch is a daunting task. We support the modeling process by utilizing an available set of 3D candidate models. Specifically, the user creates a digital 3D model as a geometric variation from a 3D candidate. Our modeling technique consists of two major steps. The first step is a user-guided image-space object segmentation to reveal the structure of the photographed object. The core step is the second one, in which a 3D candidate is automatically deformed to fit the photographed target under the guidance of silhouette correspondence. The set of candidate models have been pre-analyzed to possess useful high-level structural information, which is heavily utilized in both steps to compensate for the ill-posedness of the analysis and modeling problems based only on content in a single image. Equally important, the structural information is preserved by the geometric variation so that the final product is coherent with its inherited structural information readily usable for subsequent model refinement or processing.

Direct copying and blending using existing compositing tools results in semantically unnatural composites, since expression is a global effect and the local component in one expression is often incompatible with the shape and other components of the face in another expression. To solve this problem we present Expression Flow, a 2D flow field which can warp the target face globally in a natural way, so that the warped face is compatible with the new facial component to be copied over. To do this, starting with the two input face photos, we jointly construct a pair of 3D face shapes with the same identity but different expressions. The expression flow is computed by projecting the difference between the two 3D shapes back to 2D. It describes how to warp the target face photo to match the expression of the reference photo.

While volume scattering can produce highly realistic images of such materials, creating the required volume density models is difficult. Procedural approaches require significant programmer effort and intuition to design specialpurpose algorithms for each material. Further, the resulting models lack the visual complexity of real materials with their naturallyarising irregularities. This paper proposes a new approach to acquiring volume models, based on density data from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans and appearance data from photographs under uncontrolled illumination. To model a material, a CT scan is made, resulting in a scalar density volume. This 3D data is processed to extract orientation information and remove noise. The resulting density and orientation fields are used in an appearance matching procedure to define scattering properties in the volume that, when rendered, produce images with texture statistics that match the photographs. As our results show, this approach can easily produce volume appearance models with extreme detail, and at larger scales the distinctive textures and highlights of a range of very different fabrics like satin and velvet emerge automatically--all based simply on having accurate mesoscale geometry.

Unfortunately, treating vibrating objects as \"rigid\" during collision and contact processing fundamentally limits the range of sounds that can be computed, and contact solvers for rigid body animation can be ill-suited for modal contact sound synthesis, producing various sound artifacts. In this paper, we resolve modal vibrations in both collision and frictional contact processing stages, thereby enabling non-rigid sound phenomena such as micro-collisions, vibrational energy exchange, and chattering. We propose a frictional multibody contact formulation and modified Staggered Projections solver which is well-suited to sound rendering and avoids noise artifacts associated with spatial and temporal contact-force fluctuations which plague prior methods. To enable practical animation and sound synthesis of numerous bodies with many coupled modes, we propose a novel asynchronous integrator with model-level adaptivity built into the frictional contact solver. Vibrational contact damping is modeled to approximate contact-dependent sound dissipation. Results are provided that demonstrate high-quality contact resolution with sound. ",

Even with per-simulation tuning, it may still cause problems by missing collisions or erroneously flagging non-collisions. We present a geometrically exact alternative guaranteed to produce the correct Boolean result (significant collision or not) as if calculated with exact arithmetic, even in degenerate scenarios. Our critical insight is that only the parity of the number of collisions is needed for robust simulation, and this parity can be calculated with simpler non-constructive predicates. In essence we analyze the roots of the nonlinear system of equations defining CCD through careful consideration of the boundary of the parameter domain. The use of new conservative culling and interval filters allows typical simulations to run as fast as with the non-robust version, but without need for tuning or worries about failure cases even in geometrically degenerate scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of geometrically exact detection with a novel adaptive cloth simulation, the first to guarantee to remain intersection-free despite frequent curvature-driven remeshing.

        "abstract": "We present a fully automatic method for design-preserving transfer of garments between characters with different body shapes. For real-life garments, such transfer is performed through a knowledge intensive and time consuming process, known as pattern grading. Our first contribution is to reformulate the criteria used in professional pattern-grading as a set of geometric requirements, respectively expressing shape or design preservation, proportionality, and fit. We then propose a fully automatic garment transfer algorithm which satisfies all of these criteria while ensuring the physical plausibility of the result. Specifically, we formulate garment transfer as a constrained optimization problem and solve it efficiently through iterative quadratic minimization. As demonstrated by our results, our method is able to automatically generate design-preserving versions of existing garments for target characters whose proportions and body shape significantly differ from those of the source. The method correctly handles the transfer of multiple layers of garment. Lastly, when source 2D patterns are available, we output graded patterns suitable for manufacturing the transferred garments. Our fully automatic design-preserving transfer method leads to significant time savings for both computer artists and fashion designers. ",

In particular, small bubbles (having diameter <1cm) in a dense foam are highly affected by surface tension, so their shapes are much less deformable compared with larger bubbles. Under this small bubble assumption, we propose a more accurate and efficient particle-based algorithm to simulate bubble dynamics and interactions. The key component of this algorithm is an approximation of foam geometry, by treating bubble particles as the sites of a weighted Voronoi diagram. The connectivity information provided by the Voronoi diagram allows us to accurately model various interaction effects among bubbles. Using Voronoi cells and weights, we can also explicitly address the volume loss issue in foam simulation, which is a common problem in previous approaches. Under this framework, we present a set of bubble interaction forces to handle miscellaneous foam behaviors, including foam structure under Plateau's laws, clusters formed by liquid surface bubbles, bubble-liquid and bubble-solid coupling, bursting and coalescing. Our experiment shows that this method can be straightforwardly incorporated into existing liquid simulators, and it can efficiently generate realistic foam animations, some of which have never been produced in graphics before.

The depth of the traced strands is solved through an optimization, which simultaneously considers depth constraints, layering constraints as well as regularization terms.

We then analyzed properties of the selected points, finding that: 1) Schelling point sets are usually highly symmetric, and 2) local curvature properties (e.g., Gauss curvature) are most helpful for identifying obvious Schelling points (tips of protrusions), but 3) global properties (e.g., segment centeredness, proximity to a symmetry axis, etc.) are required to explain more subtle features. Based on these observations, we use regression analysis to combine multiple properties into an analytical model that predicts where Schelling points are likely to be on new meshes.

Restoring shaky videos not only requires smoothing the camera motion and stabilizing the content, but also demands removing blur from video frames. However, video blur is hard to remove using existing single or multiple image deblurring techniques, as the blur kernel is both spatially and temporally varying. This paper presents a video deblurring method that can effectively restore sharp frames from blurry ones caused by camera shake. Our method is built upon the observation that due to the nature of camera shake, not all video frames are equally blurry. The same object may appear sharp on some frames while blurry on others. Our method detects sharp regions in the video, and uses them to restore blurry regions of the same content in nearby frames. Our method also ensures that the deblurred frames are both spatially and temporally coherent using patch-based synthesis. Experimental results show that our method can effectively remove complex video blur under the presence of moving objects and other outliers, which cannot be achieved using previous deconvolution-based approaches.

Second, we integrate image gradients into the patch representation and replace the usual color averaging with a screened Poisson equation solver. And third, we propose a new energy based on mixed L2/L0 norms for colors and gradients that produces a gradual transition between sources without sacrificing texture sharpness. Together, all three generalizations enable patch-based solutions to a broad class of image melding problems involving inconsistent sources: object cloning, stitching challenging panoramas, hole filling from multiple photos, and image harmonization.

We found that participants could easily distinguish between five different interaction forces, even when only one of the characters was visible. Furthermore, they were sensitive to all three types of anomalous interactions: timing errors of over 150ms were acceptable less than 50% of the time, with early or late reactions being equally perceptible; participants could perceive force mismatches, though over-reactions were more acceptable than under-reactions; finally, angular distortions when a character reacts to a pushing force reduce the acceptability of the interactions, but there is some evidence for a preference of expansion away from the pushing character's body.

The user defines the mesh topology with gestural interaction and the system continuously adjusts edge lengths by considering the physical constraints among neighboring beads. The other is automatic conversion that takes an existing polygonal model as input and generates a near-hexagonal mesh model with a near-uniform edge length as output. The system then converts the design model into a beadwork model with the appropriate wiring. Computation of an appropriate wiring path requires careful consideration, and we present an algorithm based on face stripification of the mesh. The system also provides a visual step-by-step guide to assist the manual beadwork construction process. We show several beadwork designs constructed by the authors and by test users using the system.  ",

By utilizing a low-order model and reformulating our energy functions accordingly, our algorithm runs orders of magnitude faster than previous methods without compromising quality. In addition to the immediate boosts in performance for existing modeling and real time animation tools, our approach also opens the door to new modes of control: disconnected skeletons combined with shape-aware inverse kinematics.

In this paper we introduce Manifold Exploration, a new way of handling specular paths in rendering. It is based on the idea that sets of paths contributing to the image naturally form manifolds in path space, which can be explored locally by a simple equationsolving iteration. This paper shows how to formulate and solve the required equations using only geometric information that is already generally available in ray tracing systems, and how to use this method in in two different Markov Chain Monte Carlo frameworks to accurately compute illumination from general families of paths. The resulting rendering algorithms handle specular, near-specular, glossy, and diffuse surface interactions as well as isotropic or highly anisotropic volume scattering interactions, all using the same fundamental algorithm. An implementation is demonstrated on a range of challenging scenes and evaluated against previous methods. ",

To support this interactive system, we introduce a novel analysis method for computing similarity relationships between points on 3D shapes across a collection. We encode the inherent ambiguity in these relationships using fuzzy point correspondences and propose a robust and efficient computational framework that estimates fuzzy correspondences using only a sparse set of pairwise model alignments. We evaluate our analysis method on a range of correspondence benchmarks and report substantial improvements in both speed and accuracy over existing alternatives. In addition, we demonstrate how fuzzy correspondences enable key features in our exploration tool, such as automated view alignment, ROI-based similarity search, and faceted browsing. ",

This paper presents a data-driven approach for synthesizing the 6D hand gesture data for users of low-quality input devices. Offline, we collect a library of strokes with 6D data created by trained artists. Online, given a query stroke as a series of 2D positions, we synthesize the 4D hand pose data at each sample based on samples from the library that locally match the query. This framework optionally can also modify the stroke trajectory to match characteristic shapes in the style of the library. Our algorithm outputs a 6D trajectory that can be fed into any virtual brush stroke engine to make expressive strokes for novices or users of limited hardware. ",

There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing.

Our framework is not specific to humans, but applies to characters of arbitrary morphology and limb configuration. The approach is fully automatic and does not require domain knowledge specific to each behavior. It also does not require pre-existing examples or motion capture data. At the core of our framework is the contact-invariant optimization (CIO) method we introduce here. It enables simultaneous optimization of contact and behavior. This is done by augmenting the search space with scalar variables that indicate whether a potential contact should be active in a given phase of the movement. These auxiliary variables affect not only the cost function but also the dynamics (by enabling and disabling contact forces), and are optimized together with the movement trajectory. Additional innovations include a continuation scheme allowing helper forces at the potential contacts rather than the torso, as well as a feature-based model of physics which is particularly well-suited to the CIO framework. We expect that CIO can also be used with a full physics model, but leave that extension for future work. ",

We show that photography in this regime is equivalent to a matrix probing operation in which the elements of the scene's transport matrix are individually re-scaled and then mapped to the photo. This makes it possible to directly acquire photos in which specific light transport paths have been blocked, attenuated or enhanced. We show captured photos for several scenes with challenging light transport effects, including specular inter-reflections, caustics, diffuse inter-reflections and volumetric scattering.

Key to our approach is a generalization of the notion of map that puts in correspondence real-valued functions rather than points on the shapes. By choosing a multi-scale basis for the function space on each shape, such as the eigenfunctions of its Laplace-Beltrami operator, we obtain a representation of a map that is very compact, yet fully suitable for global inference. Perhaps more remarkably, most natural constraints on a map, such as descriptor preservation, landmark correspondences, part preservation and operator commutativity become linear in this formulation. Moreover, the representation naturally supports certain algebraic operations such as map sum, difference and composition, and enables a number of applications, such as function or annotation transfer without establishing pointto-point correspondences. We exploit these properties to devise an efficient shape matching method, at the core of which is a single linear solve. The new method achieves state-of-the-art results on an isometric shape matching benchmark.

For complex boundary conditions we propose an orthogonal turbulence model that handles vortices caused by obstacle interaction. In addition, we demonstrate a re-sampling scheme to remove surfaces that are hidden inside the bulk volume. In this way we are able to achieve highly detailed simulations of turbulent plumes efficiently.",

        "abstract": "Using existing programming tools, writing high-performance image processing code requires sacrificing readability, portability, and modularity. We argue that this is a consequence of conflating what computations define the algorithm, with decisions about storage and the order of computation. We refer to these latter two concerns as the schedule, including choices of tiling, fusion, recomputation vs. storage, vectorization, and parallelism. We propose a representation for feed-forward imaging pipelines that separates the algorithm from its schedule, enabling highperformance without sacrificing code clarity. This decoupling simplifies the algorithm specification: images and intermediate buffers become functions over an infinite integer domain, with no explicit storage or boundary conditions. Imaging pipelines are compositions of functions. Programmers separately specify scheduling strategies for the various functions composing the algorithm, which allows them to efficiently explore different optimizations without changing the algorithmic code. We demonstrate the power of this representation by expressing a range of recent image processing applications in an embedded domain specific language called Halide, and compiling them for ARM, x86, and GPUs. Our compiler targets SIMD units, multiple cores, and complex memory hierarchies. We demonstrate that it can handle algorithms such as a camera raw pipeline, the bilateral grid, fast local Laplacian filtering, and image segmentation. The algorithms expressed in our language are both shorter and faster than state-of-the-art implementations. ",

We propose a new approach to precise positioning of a tool that combines manual and automatic positioning: in our approach, the user coarsely positions a frame containing the tool in an approximation of the desired path, while the device tracks the frames location and adjusts the position of the tool within the frame to correct the users positioning error in real time. Because the automatic positioning need only cover the range of the humans positioning error, this frame can be small and inexpensive, and because the human has unlimited range, such a frame can be used to precisely position tools over an unlimited range.",

In this paper, we present a method that uses projector light modulator panels (e.g. LCD or DMD panels) of resolution n × n to create a perceptually close match to a target higher resolution cn×cn image, where c is a small integer greater than 1. This is achieved by enhancing the resolution using smaller pixels at specific regions of interest like edges. A target high resolution image (cn×cn) is first decomposed into (a) a high resolution (cn × cn) but sparse edge image, and (b) a complementary lower resolution (n×n) non-edge image. These images are then projected in a time sequential manner at a high frame rate to create an edge-enhanced image – an image where the pixel density is not uniform but changes spatially. In 3D ready projectors with readily available refresh rate of 120Hz, such a temporal multiplexing is imperceptible to the user and the edge-enhanced image is perceptually almost identical to the target high resolution image. To create the higher resolution edge image, we introduce the concept of optical pixel sharing. This reduces the projected pixel size by a factor of 1/c2 while increasing the pixel density by c2 at the edges enabling true higher resolution edges. Due to the sparsity of the edge pixels in an image we are able to choose a sufficiently large subset of these to be displayed at the higher resolution using perceptual parameters. We present a statistical analysis quantifying the expected number of pixels that will be reproduced at the higher resolution and verify it for different types of images.",

We use the artist-drawn cross-sections to automatically infer the 3D normals across the sketch, enabling 3D-like rendering. The technical contribution of our work is twofold. First, we distill artistic guidelines for drawing cross-sections and insights from perception literature to introduce an explicit mathematical formulation of the relationships between cross-section curves and the geometry they aim to convey. We then use these relationships to develop an algorithm for estimating a normal field from cross-section curve networks and other curves present in concept sketches.

Our algorithm is the first to satisfy all identified desiderata, including simultaneously guaranteeing symmetry preservation, kinetic energy conservation, and allowing break-away. Furthermore, we address the associated problem of inelastic collapse, proposing a complementary generalized restitution model that eliminates this source of nontermination. We then consider the application of our models to the synchronous time-integration of large-scale assemblies of impacting rigid bodies. To enable such simulations we formulate a consistent frictional impact model that continues to satisfy the desiderata.

Moreover, there is no guarantee that a printed model is structurally sound. The printed product often does not survive cleaning, transportation, or handling, or it may even collapse under its own weight. We present a system that addresses this issue by providing automatic detection and correction of the problematic cases. The structural problems are detected by combining a lightweight structural analysis solver with 3D medial axis approximations. After areas with high structural stress are found, the model is corrected by combining three approaches: hollowing, thickening, and strut insertion.

Current seam computation algorithms use optimization methods that may be slow, sequential, memory intensive, and prone to finding suboptimal solutions related to local minima of the chosen energy function. Moreover, even when these techniques perform well, their solution may not be perceptually ideal (or even good). Such an inflexible approach does not allow the possibility of user-based improvement. This paper introduces the Panorama Weaving technique for seam creation and editing in an image mosaic. First, Panorama Weaving provides a procedure to create boundaries for panoramas that is fast, has low memory requirements and is easy to parallelize. This technique often produces seams with lower energy than the competing global technique. Second, it provides the first interactive technique for the exploration of the seam solution space. This powerful editing capability allows the user to automatically extract energy minimizing seams given a sparse set of constraints. With a variety of empirical results, we show how Panorama Weaving allows the computation and editing of a wide range of digital panoramas including unstructured configurations.

This is achieved through a formulation of the DCI diffusion process in terms of Green's functions. This formulation furthermore allows the texture value of any rectangular region (e.g. pixel area) to be solved in closed form, which facilitates anti-aliasing.

        "abstract": "Human stereo perception of glossy materials is substantially different from the perception of diffuse surfaces: A single point on a diffuse object appears the same for both eyes, whereas it appears different to both eyes on a specular object. As highlights are blurry reflections of light sources they have depth themselves, which is different from the depth of the reflecting surface. We call this difference in depth impression the \"highlight disparity\". Due to artistic motivation, for technical reasons, or because of incomplete data, highlights often have to be depicted on-surface, without any disparity. However, it has been shown that a lack of disparity decreases the perceived glossiness and authenticity of a material. To remedy this contradiction, our work introduces a technique for depiction of glossy materials, which improves over simple on-surface highlights, and avoids the problems of physical highlights. Our technique is computationally simple, can be easily integrated in an existing (GPU) shading system, and allows for local and interactive artistic control.  for solid diffuse surfaces, it no longer holds for view-dependent shading. Highlights, which are blurry images of the light sources, have their own depth, different from the surface on which they are visible (Fig. 2), and they are potential source of excessive disparities. Additionally, depending on the geometry of the reflecting surface, highlights can change shape, disappear, produce vertical disparities or result in different specular flow in both eyes. One solution to this problem is to assume a common (cyclopean) eye position when shading the surface. Doing so, we avoid conflicts, however highlights seem to be painted onto the surface. This is a significant shortcoming, as it is known, that highlight disparity is a strong factor for the perception of gloss [Blake and Blthoff 1990; Hurlbert et al. 1991; Sakano and Ando 2010] and material authenticity [Wendt et al. 2008]. Nevertheless on-surface highlights are quite common, presumably for three main reasons: Because artists consider them to be more pleasant to watch; because of performance (e. g., in games that can not afford to shade twice [Sousa et al. 2012]); and because the necessary information is missing (e. g., in 2D-to-3D conversion).

Using this representation we introduce a unified optimization framework, based on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF), encompassing all tensor display architectures. This framework is the first to allow joint multilayer, multiframe light field decompositions, significantly reducing artifacts observed with prior multilayer-only and multiframe-only decompositions; it is also the first optimization method for designs combining multiple layers with directional backlighting. We verify the benefits and limitations of tensor displays by constructing a prototype using modified LCD panels and a custom integral imaging backlight. Our efficient, GPU-based NTF implementation enables interactive applications.

We introduce a novel part crossover operator which works at the finer-level part structures of the shapes, leading to significant variations and thus increased diversity in the evolved shape structures. Diversity is also achieved by explicitly compromising the fitness scores on a portion of the evolving population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of set evolution on man-made shapes.

Existing binocular display systems only utilize this additional image domain for stereopsis. Our human vision is not only able to fuse two displaced images, but also two images with difference in detail, contrast and luminance, up to a certain limit. This phenomenon is known as binocular single vision. Humans can perceive more visual content via binocular fusion than just a linear blending of two views. In this paper, we make a first attempt in computer graphics to utilize this human vision phenomenon, and propose a binocular tone mapping framework. The proposed framework generates a binocular low-dynamic range (LDR) image pair that preserves more human-perceivable visual content than a single LDR image using the additional image domain. Given a tone-mapped LDR image (left, without loss of generality), our framework optimally synthesizes its counterpart (right) in the image pair from the same source HDR image. The two LDR images are different, so that they can aggregately present more human-perceivable visual richness than a single arbitrary LDR image, without triggering visual discomfort. To achieve this goal, a novel binocular viewing comfort predictor (BVCP) is also proposed to prevent such visual discomfort. The design of BVCP is based on the findings in vision science. Through our user studies, we demonstrate the increase of human-perceivable visual richness and the effectiveness of the proposed BVCP in conservatively predicting the visual discomfort threshold of human observers.

Accurately modeling this structural detail can produce highly realistic renderings of fabrics and is critical for predictive rendering of fabric appearance. But building these yarnlevel volumetric models is challenging. Procedural techniques are manually intensive, and fail to capture the naturally arising irregularities which contribute significantly to the overall appearance of cloth. Techniques that acquire the detailed 3D structure of real fabric samples are constrained only to model the scanned samples and cannot represent different fabric designs. This paper presents a new approach to creating volumetric models of woven cloth, which starts with user-specified fabric designs and produces models that correctly capture the yarn-level structural details of cloth. We create a small database of volumetric exemplars by scanning fabric samples with simple weave structures. To build an output model, our method synthesizes a new volume by copying data from the exemplars at each yarn crossing to match a weave pattern that specifies the desired output structure. Our results demonstrate that our approach generalizes well to complex designs and can produce highly realistic results at both large and small scales. ",

In particular, no single algorithm is available to generate different noise patterns according to user-defined spectra. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for generating point samples that match a user-defined Fourier spectrum function. Such a spectrum function can be either obtained from a known sampling method, or completely constructed by the user. Our key idea is to convert the Fourier spectrum function into a differential distribution function that describes the samples' local spatial statistics; we then use a gradient descent solver to iteratively compute a sample set that matches the target differential distribution function. Our algorithm can be easily modified to achieve adaptive sampling, and we provide a GPU-based implementation.

Furthermore, it is readily generalized to simplicial maps of any dimension, including mixed dimensions. Finally, it can deal with different distortion spaces, such as bounded isometric distortion.

We gather and analyze data from a number of artists as they sketch a human face from a reference photograph. To achieve different levels of abstraction in the sketches, decreasing time limits were imposed  from four and a half minutes to fifteen seconds. We analyzed the data at two levels: strokes and geometric shape. In each, we create a model that captures both the style of the different artists and the process of abstraction. These models are then used for a portrait sketch synthesis application. Starting from a novel face photograph, we can synthesize a sketch in the various artistic styles and in different levels of abstraction. Links: DL PDF WEB ",

Most triangle meshes in practice do not exhibit desirable geometric properties, so we develop a solution that is independent of standard assumptions and robust to geometric errors. Specifically, we provide the first method for topology change applicable to arbitrary non-solid, non-manifold, non-closed, self-intersecting surfaces. We prove that this new method for topology change produces the expected conventional results when applied to solid (closed, manifold, non-self-intersecting) surfaces--that is, we prove a backwardscompatibility property relative to prior work. Beyond solid surfaces, we present empirical evidence that our method remains tolerant to a variety of surface aberrations through the incorporation of a novel error correction scheme. Finally, we demonstrate how topology change applied to non-solid objects enables wholly new and useful behaviors. ",

Our parser takes a sewing pattern in PDF format as input and starts by extracting the set of panels and styling elements (e.g. darts, pleats and hemlines) contained in the pattern. It then applies a combination of machine learning and integer programming to infer how the panels must be stitched together to form the garment. Our system includes an interactive garment simulator that takes the parsed result and generates the corresponding 3D model. Our fully automatic approach correctly parses 68% of the sewing patterns in our collection. Most of the remaining patterns contain only a few errors that can be quickly corrected within the garment simulator. Finally we present two applications that take advantage of our collection of parsed sewing patterns. Our garment hybrids application lets users smoothly interpolate multiple garments in the 2D space of patterns.

The naive application of a high-resolution surface tracker to a low-resolution velocity field can produce many visually disturbing physical and topological artifacts that limit their use in practice. We address these problems by defining an error function which compares the current state of the surface tracker to the set of physically valid surface states. By reducing this error with a gradient descent technique, we introduce a novel physics-based surface fairing method. Similarly, by treating this error function as a potential energy, we derive a new surface correction force that mimics the vortex sheet equations. We demonstrate our results with both level set and mesh-based surface trackers. ",

        "abstract": "Quadrilateral remeshing approaches based on global parametrization enable many desirable mesh properties. Two of the most important ones are (1) high regularity due to explicit control over irregular vertices and (2) smooth distribution of distortion achieved by convex variational formulations. Apart from these strengths, state-of-the-art techniques suffer from limited reliability on realworld input data, i.e. the determined map might have degeneracies like (local) non-injectivities and consequently often cannot be used directly to generate a quadrilateral mesh. In this paper we propose a novel convex Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) formulation which ensures by construction that the resulting map is within the class of so called Integer-Grid Maps that are guaranteed to imply a quad mesh. In order to overcome the NP-hardness of MIQP and to be able to remesh typical input geometries in acceptable time we propose two additional problem specific optimizations: a complexity reduction algorithm and singularity separating conditions. While the former decouples the dimension of the MIQP search space from the input complexity of the triangle mesh and thus is able to dramatically speed up the computation without inducing inaccuracies, the latter improves the continuous relaxation, which is crucial for the success of modern MIQP optimizers. Our experiments show that the reliability of the resulting algorithm does not only annihilate the main drawback of parametrization based quad-remeshing but moreover enables the global search for high-quality coarse quad layouts - a difficult task solely tackled by greedy methodologies before.

In this work, we present a method that allows a user to transfer the color palette of a model video clip to their own video sequence. We estimate a per-frame color transform that maps the color distributions in the input video sequence to that of the model video clip. Applying this transformation naively leads to artifacts such as bleeding and flickering. Instead, we propose a novel differentialgeometry-based scheme that interpolates these transformations in a manner that minimizes their curvature, similarly to curvature flows. In addition, we automatically determine a set of keyframes that best represent this interpolated transformation curve, and can be used subsequently, to manually refine the color grade. We show how our method can successfully transfer color palettes between videos for a range of visual styles and a number of input video clips. ",

Traditionally, professional photographers work in a studio with many light sources carefully set up, with the goal of getting a near-final image at exposure time, with post-processing mostly focusing on aspects orthogonal to lighting. Recently, a new workflow has emerged for architectural and commercial photography, where photographers capture several photos from a fixed viewpoint with a moving light source. The objective is not to produce the final result immediately, but rather to capture useful data that are later processed, often significantly, in photo editing software to create the final well-lit image. This new workflow is flexible, requires less manual setup, and works well for time-constrained shots. But dealing with several tens of unorganized layers is painstaking, requiring hours to days of manual effort, as well as advanced photo editing skills. Our objective in this paper is to make the compositing step easier. We describe a set of optimizations to assemble the input images to create a few basis lights that correspond to common goals pursued by photographers, e.g., accentuating edges and curved regions. We also introduce modifiers that capture standard photographic tasks, e.g., to alter the lights to soften highlights and shadows, akin to umbrellas and soft boxes. Our experiments with novice and professional users show that our approach allows them to quickly create satisfying results, whereas working with unorganized images requires considerably more time. Casual users particularly benefit from our approach since coping with a large number of layers is daunting for them and requires significant experience. ",

One way to address this is to capture models directly from the real world. Existing techniques have focused on extracting macro structure such as the branching structure of trees, or the structure of broad-leaved plants with a relatively small number of surfaces. This paper presents a finer scale technique to demonstrate for the first time the processing of densely leaved foliage - computation of 3D structure, plus extraction of statistics for leaf shape and the configuration of neighboring leaves. Our method starts with a mesh of a single exemplar leaf of the target foliage. Using a small number of images, point cloud data is obtained from multi-view stereo, and the exemplar leaf mesh is fitted non-rigidly to the point cloud over several iterations. In addition, our method learns a statistical model of leaf shape and appearance during the reconstruction phase, and a model of the transformations between neighboring leaves. This information is useful in two ways - to augment and increase leaf density in reconstructions of captured foliage, and to synthesize new foliage that conforms to a user-specified layout and density. The result of our technique is a dense set of captured leaves with realistic appearance, and a method for leaf synthesis. Our approach excels at reconstructing plants and bushes that are primarily defined by dense leaves and is demonstrated with multiple examples. ",

With the aim of precisely integrating the rod kinematic problem, for which no closed-form solution exists, we introduce a dedicated integration scheme based on power series expansions. It turns out that our algorithm reaches machine precision orders of magnitude faster compared to classical numerical integrators. This property, nicely preserved under simple algebraic and differential operations, allows us to compute all spatial terms of the rod kinematics and dynamics in both an efficient and accurate way. Combined with a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme, our method leads to the efficient and robust simulation of arbitrary curly filaments that exhibit rich, visually pleasing configurations and motion. Our approach was successfully applied to generate various scenarios such as the unwinding of a curled ribbon as well as the aesthetic animation of spiral-like hair or the fascinating growth of twining plants.

In this paper, we propose an abstraction mechanism that simplifies the design, development, implementation, and reuse of these algorithms. Our solution relies on two new data structures: a reducer tree that efficiently parameterizes the space of material assignments and a tuner network that describes the optimization process used to compute material arrangement.

The identification of these handle and tunnel loops can benefit a broad range of applications from topology simplification / repair, and surface parameterization, to feature and shape recognition. Many of the existing efficient algorithms for computing non-trivial loops cannot be used to compute these special type of loops. The two algorithms known for computing handle and tunnel loops provably have a serious drawback that they both require a tessellation of the interior and exterior spaces bounded by the surface. Computing such a tessellation of three dimensional space around the surface is a non-trivial task and can be quite expensive. Furthermore, such a tessellation may need to refine the surface mesh, thus causing the undesirable side-effect of outputting the loops on an altered surface mesh. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to compute a basis for handle and tunnel loops without requiring any 3D tessellation. This saves time considerably for large meshes making the algorithm scalable while computing the loops on the original input mesh and not on some refined version of it. We use the concept of the Reeb graph which together with several key theoretical insights on linking number provide an initial set of loops that provably constitute a handle and a tunnel basis. We further develop a novel strategy to tighten these handle and tunnel basis loops to make them geometrically relevant.

The research that does exist on this topic has consistently demonstrated that significant performance and efficiency gains can be achieved with dedicated microarchitectures. However, previous work on hardware ray-tracing has focused almost entirely on the traversal and intersection aspects of the pipeline. As a result, the critical aspect of the management and construction of acceleration data-structures remains largely absent from the hardware literature.

To this end, we have developed the first dedicated microarchitecture for the construction of binned SAH BVHs.

In this paper, we present a new method for consistent editing of photo collections. Our method automatically enforces consistent appearance of images that share content even without requiring any user input. When the user does make changes to selected images, these changes automatically propagate to other images in the collection, while still maintaining as much consistency as possible. This enables interactively adjusting an entire photo album in a consistent manner by manipulating only a few images. Our method operates by efficiently constructing a graph with edges linking photo pairs that share content. Consistent appearance of connected photos is achieved by globally optimizing a quadratic cost function over the entire graph, treating user-specified edits as constraints in the optimization. The optimization is fast enough to provide interactive visual feedback to the user.

We present an efficient bottom-up algorithm that reduces an SVO to a minimal DAG, which can be applied even in cases where the complete SVO would not fit in memory. In all tested scenes, even the highly irregular ones, the number of nodes is reduced by one to three orders of magnitude. While the DAG requires more pointers per node, the memory cost for these is quickly amortized and the memory consumption of the DAG is considerably smaller, even when compared to an ideal SVO without pointers. Meanwhile, our sparse voxel DAG requires no decompression and can be traversed very efficiently.

We propose an algorithm that leverages coherence in massive light fields by breaking with a number of established practices in image-based reconstruction.

More homogeneous interior regions are then processed in a fine-to-coarse procedure rather than the standard coarse-to-fine approaches. At no point in our method is any form of global optimization performed. This allows our algorithm to retain precise object contours while still ensuring smooth reconstructions in less detailed areas.

Despite various previous efforts, it remains challenging to define a closed-form inter-polant that produces natural-looking functions while allowing flexible control of boundary constraints. Our method builds on an existing transfinite interpolant over a continuous domain, which in turn extends the classical mean value interpolant. We re-derive the inter-polant from the mean value property of biharmonic functions, and prove that the interpolant indeed matches the gradient constraints when the boundary is piece-wise linear. We then give closed-form formula (as generalized barycentric coordinates) for boundary constraints represented as polynomials up to degree 3 (for values) and 1 (for normal derivatives) over each polygon edge. We demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of our coordinates in two novel applications, smooth image deformation using curved cage networks and adaptive simplification of gradient meshes.",

It can stretch and slide over underlying body structures such as muscles, bones, and tendons, revealing rich details of a moving character. Simulating such skin is challenging because it is in close contact with the body and shares its geometry. Despite major advances in simulating elastodynamics of cloth and soft bodies for computer graphics, such methods are difficult to use for simulating thin skin due to the need to deal with non-conforming meshes, collision detection, and contact response. We propose a novel Eulerian representation of skin that avoids all the difficulties of constraining the skin to lie on the body surface by working directly on the surface itself. Skin is modeled as a 2D hyperelastic membrane with arbitrary topology, which makes it easy to cover an entire character or object. Unlike most Eulerian simulations, we do not require a regular grid and can use triangular meshes to model body and skin geometry. The method is easy to implement, and can use low resolution meshes to animate high-resolution details stored in texture-like maps. Skin movement is driven by the animation of body shape prescribed by an artist or by another simulation, and so it can be easily added as a post-processing stage to an existing animation pipeline. We provide several examples simulating human and animal skin, and skin-tight clothes. ",

As a result, the system is highly deployable and easy to use: it can faithfully track any individual, starting from just a single face scan of the subject in a neutral pose. Like many real-time methods, we use a linear subspace to cope with incomplete input data and fast motion. To boost the training of our tracking model with reliable samples, we use a well-trained 2D facial feature tracker on the input video and an efficient mesh deformation algorithm to snap the result of the previous step to high frequency details in visible depth map regions. We show that the combination of dense depth maps and texture features around eyes and lips is essential in capturing natural dialogues and nuanced actor-specific emotions.

Due to their ubiquity, controlling the appearance and behavior of such phenomena is important for a variety of graphics applications. However, such control is often challenging; the repetitive elements are often too numerous for manual edit, while their overall structures are often too versatile for fully automatic computation. We propose a method that facilitates easy and intuitive controls at both scales: high-level structures through spatial-temporal output constraints (e.g. overall shape and motion of the output domain), and low-level details through small input exemplars (e.g. element arrangements and movements). These controls are suitable for manual specification, while the corresponding geometric and dynamic repetitions are suitable for automatic computation. Our system takes such user controls as inputs, and generates as outputs the corresponding repetitions satisfying the controls. Our method, which we call dynamic element textures, aims to produce such controllable repetitions through a combination of constrained optimization (satisfying controls) and data driven computation (synthesizing details). We use spatial-temporal samples as the core representation for dynamic geometric elements.

A number of methods were proposed for automatic choice of cone positions, either based on singularities of cross-fields and emphasizing alignment, or based on distortion optimization. In this paper we describe a method for placing cones for seamless global parametrizations with alignment constraints. We use a close relation between variation-minimizing cross-fields and related 1forms and conformal maps, and demonstrate how it leads to a constrained optimization problem formulation. We show for boundaryaligned parametrizations metric distortion may be reduced by cone chains, sometimes to an arbitrarily small value, and the trade-off between the distortion and the number of cones can be controlled by a regularization term. Constrained parametrizations computed using our method have significantly lower distortion compared to the state-of-the art field-based method, yet maintain feature and boundary alignment.

Our two-way coupled model produces the expected wrinkling behavior without the computational expense of a large number of volumetric elements to model deformations under the surface. We use C1 quadratic shape functions for the interior deformations, allowing very coarse resolutions to model the overall global deformation efficiently, while avoiding visual artifacts of wrinkling at discretization boundaries. We demonstrate that our model produces wrinkle wavelengths that match both theoretical predictions and high resolution volumetric simulations. We also show example applications in simulating wrinkles on passive objects, such as furniture, and for wrinkles on faces in character animation. ",

        "abstract": "We present radiance regression functions for fast rendering of global illumination in scenes with dynamic local light sources. A radiance regression function (RRF) represents a non-linear mapping from local and contextual attributes of surface points, such as position, viewing direction, and lighting condition, to their indirect illumination values. The RRF is obtained from precomputed shading samples through regression analysis, which determines a function that best fits the shading data. For a given scene, the shading samples are precomputed by an offline renderer. The key idea behind our approach is to exploit the nonlinear coherence of the indirect illumination data to make the RRF both compact and fast to evaluate. We model the RRF as a multilayer acyclic feed-forward neural network, which provides a close functional approximation of the indirect illumination and can be efficiently evaluated at run time. To effectively model scenes with spatially variant material properties, we utilize an augmented set of attributes as input to the neural network RRF to reduce the amount of inference that the network needs to perform. To handle scenes with greater geometric complexity, we partition the input space of the RRF model and represent the subspaces with separate, smaller RRFs that can be evaluated more rapidly. As a result, the RRF model scales well to increasingly complex scene geometry and material variation. Because of its compactness and ease of evaluation, the RRF model enables real-time rendering with full global illumination effects, including changing caustics and multiple-bounce high-frequency glossy interreflections.

Our difference operator, derived from a shape map, is much more informative than just a scalar global shape similarity score, rendering it useful in a variety of applications where more refined shape comparisons are necessary. The approach is intrinsic and is based on a linear algebraic framework, allowing the use of many common linear algebra tools (e.g, SVD, PCA) for studying a matrix representation of the operator. Remarkably, the formulation allows us not only to localize shape differences on the shapes involved, but also to compare shape differences across pairs of shapes, and to analyze the variability in entire shape collections based on the differences between the shapes. Moreover, while we use a map or correspondence to define each shape difference, consistent correspondences between the shapes are not necessary for comparing shape differences, although they can be exploited if available. We give a number of applications of shape differences, including parameterizing the intrinsic variability in a shape collection, exploring shape collections using local variability at different scales, performing shape analogies, and aligning shape collections.

A common strategy to calculate these highdimensional integrals is to average the estimates at stochastically sampled locations. The strategy with which the sampled locations are chosen is of utmost importance in deciding the quality of the approximation, and hence rendered image. We derive connections between the spectral properties of stochastic sampling patterns and the first and second order statistics of estimates of integration using the samples. Our equations provide insight into the assessment of stochastic sampling strategies for integration. We show that the amplitude of the expected Fourier spectrum of sampling patterns is a useful indicator of the bias when used in numerical integration. We deduce that estimator variance is directly dependent on the variance of the sampling spectrum over multiple realizations of the sampling pattern. We then analyse Gaussian jittered sampling, a simple variant of jittered sampling, that allows a smooth trade-off of bias for variance in uniform (regular grid) sampling. We verify our predictions using spectral measurement, quantitative integration experiments and qualitative comparisons of rendered images. ",

A question naturally raised is how to generate line segment samples with good properties that can effectively reduce variance and aliasing artifacts observed in the rendering results. This paper studies this problem and presents a frequency analysis of line segment sampling. The analysis shows that the frequency content of a line segment sample is equivalent to the weighted frequency content of a point sample. The weight introduces anisotropy that smoothly changes among point samples, line segment samples and line samples according to the lengths of the samples. Line segment sampling thus makes it possible to achieve a balance between noise (point sampling) and aliasing (line sampling) under the same sampling rate. Based on the analysis, we propose a line segment sampling scheme to preserve blue-noise properties of samples which can significantly reduce noise and aliasing artifacts in reconstruction results. We demonstrate that our sampling scheme improves the quality of depth-of-field rendering, motion blur rendering, and temporal light field reconstruction.",

The smooth subdivision surfaces defined by the coarse quad meshes demonstrate the suitability of our approach for practical production pipelines. Abstract Coarse quad meshes are the preferred representation for animating characters in movies and video games. In these scenarios, artists want explicit control over the edge flows and the singularities of the quad mesh. Despite the significant advances in recent years, existing automatic quad remeshing algorithms are not yet able to achieve the quality of manually created remeshings. We present an interactive system for manual quad remeshing that provides the user with a high degree of control while avoiding the tediousness involved in existing manual tools. With our sketch-based interface the user constructs a quad mesh by defining patches consisting of individual quads. The desired edge flow is intuitively specified by the sketched patch boundaries, and the mesh topology can be adjusted by varying the number of edge subdivisions at patch boundaries. Our system automatically inserts singularities inside patches if necessary, while providing the user with direct control of their topological and geometrical locations. We developed a set of novel user interfaces that assist the user in constructing a curve network representing such patch boundaries. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated through a user evaluation with professional artists. Our system is also useful for editing automatically generated quad meshes.",

The insight is to exploit the advanced composition mechanism of volumetric, implicit representations for correcting the results of geometric skinning techniques. The mesh is first approximated by a set of implicit surfaces. At each animation step, these surfaces are combined in real-time and used to adjust the position of mesh vertices, starting from their smooth skinning position. This deformation step is done without any loss of detail and seamlessly handles contacts between skin parts. As it acts as a post-process, our method fits well into the standard animation pipeline.

However, as soon as the viewer moves away from the correct viewpoint, the image in the retina becomes distorted, sometimes leading to gross misperceptions of the original geometry. Two hypotheses from vision science state how viewers perceive such image distortions, one claiming that they can compensate for them (and therefore perceive scene geometry reasonably correctly), and one claiming that they cannot compensate (and therefore can perceive rather significant distortions). We modified the latter hypothesis so that it extends to street-level IBR. We then conducted a rigorous experiment that measured the magnitude of perceptual distortions that occur with IBR for facade viewing. We also conducted a rating experiment that assessed the acceptability of the distortions. The results of the two experiments were consistent with one another. They showed that viewers' percepts are indeed distorted, but not as severely as predicted by the modified vision science hypothesis. From our experimental results, we develop a predictive model of distortion for street-level IBR, which we use to provide guidelines for acceptability of virtual views and for capture camera density. We perform a confirmatory study to validate our predictions, and illustrate their use with an application that guides users in IBR navigation to stay in regions where virtual views yield acceptable perceptual distortions.

A pilot study indicates that it is promising to use our technique as an alternative but more efficient tool of standard 3D modeling for 3D scene construction.  or models by properly recombining the existing models or their parts. Sketch-based user interface is commonly adopted for this task mainly due to its simplicity, intuitiveness, and ease of use [Eitz et al. 2012]. It has been shown that casually drawn sketches can be used as both shape queries for model retrieval and alignment cues for model placement, greatly simplifying the modeling process. The existing techniques for sketch-based search and composition of 3D models [Shin and Igarashi 2007; Lee and Funkhouser 2008; Xie et al. 2012] typically repeat the following process for individual desired models: first 2D sketch, then retrieval and finally 3D placement. This iterative 2D-3D-2D process is not compatible with the traditional design workflow (i.e., 2D concept design followed by 3D modeling), which is largely sequential and often demands different professionals specialized for different tasks (e.g., concept artists, 3D modelers) [Chopine 2011]. In addition, their performance is highly sensitive to the quality of individual sketches. User intervention is thus often needed for every step in the process.  ",

By introducing layering into the analysis, we no longer view a facade as a flat structure, but allow it to be structurally separated into depth layers, enabling more compact and natural interpretations of building facades. Computationally, we perform a symmetry-driven search for an optimal hierarchical decomposition defined by split and layering operations applied to an input facade. The objective is symmetry maximization, i.e., to maximize the sum of symmetry of the substructures resulting from recursive decomposition. To this end, we propose a novel integral symmetry measure, which behaves well at both ends of the symmetry spectrum by accounting for all partial symmetries in a discrete structure. Our analysis results in a structural representation, which can be utilized for structural editing and exploration of building facades. ",

However, rendering such complex volumetric media is expensive, with bruteforce path tracing often the only viable solution. Fortunately, common volumetric materials (fabrics, finished wood, synthesized solid textures) are structured, with repeated patterns approximated by tiling a small number of exemplar blocks. In this paper, we introduce a precomputation-based rendering approach for such volumetric media with repeated structures based on a modular transfer formulation. We model each exemplar block as a voxel grid and precompute voxel-to-voxel, patch-to-patch, and patch-to-voxel flux transfer matrices. At render time, when blocks are tiled to produce a high-resolution volume, we accurately compute low-order scattering, with modular flux transfer used to approximate higher-order scattering. We achieve speedups of up to 12 over path tracing on extremely complex volumes, with minimal loss of quality. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms photon mapping on these materials. ",

Given an input polygonal mesh endowed with a Riemannian metric and a specified number of vertices, the method generates a metric-adapted mesh. The main idea consists of mapping the anisotropic space into a higher dimensional isotropic one, called embedding space. The vertices of the mesh are generated by uniformly sampling the surface in this higher dimensional embedding space, and the sampling is further regularized by optimizing an energy function with a quasi-Newton algorithm. All the computations can be re-expressed in terms of the dot product in the embedding space, and the Jacobian matrices of the mappings that connect different spaces. This transform makes it unnecessary to explicitly represent the coordinates in the embedding space, and also provides all necessary expressions of energy and forces for efficient computations. Through energy optimization, it naturally leads to the de- sired anisotropic particle distributions in the original space. The triangles are then generated by computing the Restricted Anisotropic Voronoi Diagram and its dual Delaunay triangulation. We compare our results qualitatively and quantitatively with the state-of-the-art in anisotropic surface meshing on several examples, using the standard measurement criteria.",

The key concept of representativity requires that the focal points occur frequently in the cluster and that they result in a compact cluster. Hence, the problem of focal point extraction is intermixed with the problem of clustering groups of scenes based on their representative focal points. We present a co-analysis algorithm which interleaves frequent pattern mining and subspace clustering to extract a set of contextual focal points which guide the clustering of the scene collection.

The construction of the algorithm stems from two novel observations: first, bijections between disk-type surfaces can be uniquely and efficiently represented via consistent locally injective flattenings that are allowed to be globally overlapping. This observation reduces the problem of computing bijective surface mappings to the task of computing locally injective flattenings, which is shown to be easier. Second, locally injective flattenings that minimize isometric distortion can be efficiently characterized and optimized in a convex framework. Experiments that map a wide baseline of pairs of surface meshes using the algorithm are provided. They demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to produce high-quality continuous bijective mappings between pairs of surfaces of varying isometric distortion levels. ",

This paper presents a complete exposition of similarity theory, which provides fundamental insights into the structure of the RTE's parameter space.

This involves capturing an actor while they perform different expressions that span their range of facial motion.

In order to extract true expression deformations, it is essential to factor out the rigid head movement for each expression, a process referred to as rigid stabilization. In order to achieve production-quality in industry, face stabilization is usually performed through a tedious and error-prone manual process. In this paper we present the first automatic face stabilization method that achieves professional-quality results on large sets of facial expressions. Since human faces can undergo a wide range of deformation, there is not a single point on the skin surface that moves rigidly with the underlying skull. Consequently, computing the rigid transformation from direct observation, a common approach in previous methods, is error prone and leads to inaccurate results. Instead, we propose to indirectly stabilize the expressions by explicitly aligning them to an estimate of the underlying skull using anatomically-motivated constraints. We show that the proposed method not only outperforms existing techniques but is also on par with manual stabilization, yet requires less than a second of computation time.",

Our framework supports structuring elements with arbitrary shape, accounts robustly for geometric and morphological sharp features, remains efficient at large scales and comes together with a specific adaptive sampler. Based on this meshless framework, we propose applications which benefit from the non-linear nature of morphological analysis and can be expressed as simple sequences of our operators, including medial axis sampling, hysteresis shape filtering and geometry-preserving topological simplification.

On the left, we show a 2D manifold learnt from 46 fonts. Every point in the manifold corresponds to a complete font; as you move across the manifold the corresponding font smoothly changes by interpolating and extrapolating the the original training fonts. We demonstrate this effect with the text on the right; each character is createdfrom a different 2D location in the manifold that is obtained by moving along the straight line shown on the left. The colored dots match up with the colored words. The heatmap of the manifold is indicative of the likelihood of a location containing a good font. In addition to the results presented in this paper, we provide a standalone Javascript based viewer that allows users to explore both the joint manifold offonts and manifolds for individual characters. Abstract The design and manipulation of typefaces and fonts is an area requiring substantial expertise; it can take many years of study to become a proficient typographer. At the same time, the use of typefaces is ubiquitous; there are many users who, while not experts, would like to be more involved in tweaking or changing existing fonts without suffering the learning curve of professional typography packages. Given the wealth of fonts that are available today, we would like to exploit the expertise used to produce these fonts, and to enable everyday users to create, explore, and edit fonts. To this end, we build a generative manifold of standard fonts. Every location on the manifold corresponds to a unique and novel typeface, and is obtained by learning a non-linear mapping that intelligently interpolates and extrapolates existing fonts. Using the manifold, we can smoothly interpolate and move between existing fonts. We can also use the manifold as a constraint that makes a variety of new applications possible. For instance, when editing a single character, we can update all the other glyphs in a font simultaneously to keep them compatible with our changes.",

The inferred 2D landmarks are then used to adapt the camera matrix and the user identity to better match the facial expressions of the current user. The regression and adaptation are performed in an alternating manner. With more and more facial expressions observed in the video, the whole process converges quickly with accurate facial tracking and animation. In experiments, our approach demonstrates a level of robustness and accuracy on par with state-of-theart techniques that require a time-consuming calibration step for each individual user, while running at 28 fps on average.

Our reduced model exhibits comparable hair motions and details as captured by the full simulation. Abstract Realistic hair animation is a crucial component in depicting virtual characters in interactive applications. While much progress has been made in high-quality hair simulation, the overwhelming computation cost hinders similar fidelity in realtime simulations. To bridge this gap, we propose a data-driven solution. Building upon precom-puted simulation data, our approach constructs a reduced model to optimally represent hair motion characteristics with a small number of guide hairs and the corresponding interpolation relationships. At runtime, utilizing such a reduced model, we only simulate guide hairs that capture the general hair motion and interpolate all rest strands. We further propose a hair correction method that corrects the resulting hair motion with a position-based model to resolve hair collisions and thus captures motion details. Our hair simulation method enables a simulation of a full head of hairs with over 150K strands in realtime. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our method with various hairstyles and driven motions (e.g., head movement and wind force), and compared against full simulation results that does not appear in the training data.",

We also support the decomposition of shaders into multiple parts, which are shaded at different frequencies. Shading rates can be locally and adaptively controlled, in order to direct the computations to visually important areas and to provide performance scaling with a graceful degradation of quality.

The hot plastic exits a nozzle and fuses with the part just below, adding a layer of material to the object being formed. However, filament can only be deposited on top of an existing surface. Therefore, overhangs require a disposable support structure to be printed, temporarily supporting the threads of plastic that would otherwise hang in empty space. Existing techniques for support generation fall into two categories: The first allow for very reliable prints by enclosing the bottom of the object in a dense structure, at the expense of increased material usage and build times. The second generate thin hierarchical structures connecting to the surface in a sparse number of points. This uses less material, at the expense of reliability: the part might become unstable, the structure itself may become difficult to print, the bottom surface quality degrades. The user therefore has to correct the structure and its parameters for each new object. We propose to exploit the ability of FFF printers to print bridges across gaps. Since bridges are always supported by pillars at their extremities, they are both stronger and more stable than hierarchical tree structures. Our technique first selects the points to support based on overhang and part stability during the entire print process. It then optimizes for a printable scaffolding composed of bridges and vertical pillars, supporting all points. The result is an automated support generation technique using little material while ensuring fine surface quality and stability during the printing process. ",

Samples in such algorithms are generated as a history of Markov chain states so that they are distributed according to the contributions to the image. The whole process is done based only on the information of the path contributions and user-defined transition probabilities from one state to the others. In light transport simulation, however, there is more information that can be used to improve the efficiency of path sampling. A notable example is multiple importance sampling (MIS) in bidirectional path tracing, which utilizes the probability densities of constructing a given path with different estimators. While MIS is a powerful ordinary Monte Carlo method, how to incorporate such additional information into MCMC sampling has been an open problem. We introduce a novel MCMC sampling framework, primary space serial tempering, which fuses the ideas of MCMC sampling and MIS for the first time. The key idea is to explore not only the sample space using a Markov chain, but also different estimators to generate samples by utilizing the information already available for MIS. Based on this framework, we also develop a novel rendering algorithm, multiplexed Metropolis light transport, which automatically and adaptively constructs paths with appropriate techniques as predicted by MIS. The final algorithm is very easy to implement, yet in many cases shows comparable (or even better) performance than significantly more complex MCMC rendering algorithms. ",

During subspace simulation, we select low-dimensional sets of basis vectors according to the current pose of the character and the state of its clothing. Thanks to this adaptive basis selection scheme, our method is able to reproduce diverse and detailed folding patterns with only a few basis vectors.

Such contact-rich, predictive and reactive motions have previously only been generated offline or using a handcrafted state machine or a dataset of reference motions, which our system does not require. For each animation frame, our system generates trajectories of character control parameters for the near future -- a few seconds -- using Sequential Monte Carlo sampling. Our main technical contribution is a multimodal, tree-based sampler that simultaneously explores multiple different near-term control strategies represented as parameter splines. The strategies represented by each sample are evaluated in parallel using a causal physics engine. The best strategy, as determined by an objective function measuring goal achievement, fluidity of motion, etc., is used as the control signal for the current frame, but maintaining multiple hypotheses is crucial for adapting to dynamically changing environments.

A key task in network construction is to make the maps consistent with each other. This consistency constraint, when properly defined, leads not only to a concise representation of such networks, but more importantly, it serves as a strong regularizer for correcting and improving noisy initial maps computed between pairs of shapes in isolation. Up-to-now, however, the consistency constraint has only been fully formulated for point-based maps or for shape collections that are fully similar. In this paper, we introduce a framework for computing consistent functional maps within heterogeneous shape collections. In such collections not all shapes share the same structure  different types of shared structure may be present within different (but possibly overlapping) sub-collections. Unlike point-based maps, functional maps can encode similarities at multiple levels of detail (points or parts), and thus are particularly suitable for coping with such diversity within a shape collection. We show how to rigorously formulate the consistency constraint in the functional map setting. The formulation leads to a powerful tool for computing consistent functional maps, and also for discovering shared structures, such as meaningful shape parts. We also show how to adapt the procedure for handling very large-scale shape collections.

Our method can robustly reconstruct faithful 3D hair models from unprocessed input point clouds with large amounts of outliers. Current state-of-the-art techniques use geometrically-inspired heuristics to derive global hair strand structures, which can yield implausible hair strands for hairstyles involving large occlusions, multiple layers, or wisps of varying lengths. We address this problem using a voting-based fitting algorithm to discover structurally plausible configurations among the locally grown hair segments from a database of simulated examples. To generate these examples, we exhaustively sample the simulation configurations within the feasible parameter space constrained by the current input hairstyle. The number of necessary simulations can be further reduced by leveraging symmetry and constrained initial conditions. The final hairstyle can then be structurally represented by a limited number of examples. To handle constrained hairstyles such as a ponytail of which realistic simulations are more difficult, we allow the user to sketch a few strokes to generate strand examples through an intuitive interface. Our approach focuses on robustness and generality. Since our method is structurally plausible by construction, we ensure an improved control during hair digitization and avoid implausible hair synthesis for a wide range of hairstyles. ",

It applies both to dramatically glittery surfaces that contain mirror-like flakes and also to rough surfaces that exhibit more subtle small scale glitter, without which most glossy surfaces appear too smooth in close-up. These phenomena can in principle be simulated by high-resolution normal maps, but maps with tiny features create severe aliasing problems under narrow-angle illumination. In this paper we present a stochastic model for the effects of random subpixel structures that generates glitter and spatial noise that behave correctly under different illumination conditions and viewing distances, while also being temporally coherent so that they look right in motion. The model is based on microfacet theory, but it replaces the usual continuous microfacet distribution with a discrete distribution of scattering particles on the surface. A novel stochastic hierarchy allows efficient evaluation in the presence of large numbers of random particles, without ever having to consider the particles individually.

Most recent research has focused on analyzing geometric structures of shapes. Our work is motivated by the observation that a majority of manmade shapes are designed to be used by people. Thus, in order to fully understand their semantics, one needs to answer a fundamental question: \"how do people interact with these objects?\" As an initial step towards this goal, we offer a novel algorithm for automatically predicting a static pose that a person would need to adopt in order to use an object. Specifically, given an input 3D shape, the goal of our analysis is to predict a corresponding human pose, including contact points and kinematic parameters. This is especially challenging for man-made objects that commonly exhibit a lot of variance in their geometric structure. We address this challenge by observing that contact points usually share consistent local geometric features related to the anthropometric properties of corresponding parts and that human body is subject to kinematic constraints and priors. Accordingly, our method effectively combines local region classification and global kinematically-constrained search to successfully predict poses for various objects. We also evaluate our algorithm on six diverse collections of 3D polygonal models (chairs, gym equipment, cockpits, carts, bicycles, and bipedal devices) containing a total of 147 models. Finally, we demonstrate that the poses predicted by our algorithm can be used in several shape analysis problems, such as establishing correspondences between objects, detecting salient regions, finding informative viewpoints, and retrieving functionally-similar shapes.

We further show that these sets are optimal, in the sense that there exist no larger convex sets that bound singular values.

A precomputed database of randomly sampled rigid-body contact events is used to build a contact-event graph, which can be searched to determine a plausible sequence of contact events synchronized with the input sound's events. To more easily find motions with matching contact times, we allow transitions between simulated contact events using a motion blending formulation based on modified contact impulses. We fine tune synchronization by slightly retiming ballistic motions. Given a sound, our system can synthesize synchronized motions using graphs built with hundreds of thousands of precomputed motions, and millions of contact events. Our system is easy to use, and has been used to plan motions for hundreds of sounds, and dozens of rigid-body models. ",

To improve the efficacy of these computations, we propose an alternative theory of sampling. In contrast to traditional formulations for image synthesis, which appeal to nonconstructive Dirac deltas, our theory employs constructive reproducing kernels for the correspondence between continuous functions and pointwise samples. Conceptually, this allows us to obtain a common mathematical formulation of almost all existing numerical techniques for image synthesis. Practically, it enables novel sampling based numerical techniques designed for light transport that provide considerably improved performance per sample. We exemplify the practical benefits of our formulation with three applications: pointwise transport of color spectra, projection of the light energy density into spherical harmonics, and approximation of the shading equation from a photon map. Experimental results verify the utility of our sampling formulation, with lower numerical error rates and enhanced visual quality compared to existing techniques. ",

These new variants use different rules for drawing connections, and have several advantages: no need for printed numbers in the puzzle (which look ugly in the final drawing), and perhaps more challenging \"game play\", making the puzzles suitable for different age groups. We study the rules of all four variants in the family, and design principles describing what makes a good puzzle. We identify general principles that apply across the different variants, as well as specific implementations of those principles in the different variants. We make these mathematically precise in the form of criteria a puzzle should satisfy. Furthermore, we investigate methods for the automatic generation of puzzles from a plane graph that describes the input drawing. We show that the problem of generating a good puzzle one satisfying the mentioned criteria is computationally hard, and present several heuristic algorithms. Using our implementation for generating puzzles, we evaluate the quality of the resulting puzzles with respect to two parameters: one for similarity to the original line drawing, and one for ambiguity; i.e. what is the visual accuracy needed to solve the puzzle.

Such rapid disparity changes may lead to confusion, reduced understanding of the scene, and overall attractiveness of the content. In most cases the problem cannot be solved by simply matching the depth around the transition, as this would require flattening the scene completely. To better understand this limitation of the human visual system, we conducted a series of eye-tracking experiments. The data obtained allowed us to derive and evaluate a model describing adaptation of vergence to disparity changes on a stereoscopic display. Besides computing user-specific models, we also estimated parameters of an average observer model. This enables a range of strategies for minimizing the adaptation time in the audience.",

Previous methods have attempted to filter sparsely sampled MC renders but these methods have high reconstruction overheads. Recent work has shown fast performance for individual effects, like soft shadows and indirect illumination, using axis-aligned filtering. While some components of light transport such as indirect or area illumination are smooth, they are often multiplied by high-frequency components such as texture, which prevents their sparse sampling and reconstruction. We propose an approach to adaptively sample and filter for simultaneously rendering primary (defocus blur) and secondary (soft shadows and indirect illumination) distribution effects, based on a multi-dimensional frequency analysis of the direct and indirect illumination light fields. We describe a novel approach of factoring texture and irradiance in the presence of defocus blur, which allows for pre-filtering noisy irradiance when the texture is not noisy. Our approach naturally allows for different sampling rates for primary and secondary effects, further reducing the overall ray count. While the theory considers only Lambertian surfaces, we obtain promising results for moderately glossy surfaces. We demonstrate 30× sampling rate reduction compared to equal quality noise-free MC. Combined with a GPU implementation and low filtering overhead, we can render scenes with complex geometry and diffuse and glossy BRDFs in a few seconds.",

Third, we display fonts that are most similar to a user's currentlyselected font. These tools are complementary; a user may search for \"graceful\" fonts, select a reasonable one, and then refine the results from a list of fonts similar to the selection. To enable these tools, we use crowdsourcing to gather font attribute data, and then train models to predict attribute values for new fonts. We use attributes to help learn a font similarity metric using crowdsourced comparisons. We evaluate the interfaces against a conventional list interface and find that our interfaces are preferred to the baseline. Our interfaces also produce better results in two real-world tasks: finding the nearest match to a target font, and font selection for graphic designs. ",

In this new photography regime, the projector emits a spatio-temporal 3D signal and the camera receives a transformed version of it, determined by the set of all light transport paths through the scene and the time delays they induce. The underlying 3D-to-3D transformation encodes scene geometry and global transport in great detail, but individual transport components (e.g., direct reflections, inter-reflections, caustics, etc.) are coupled nontrivially in both space and time. To overcome this complexity, we observe that transient light transport is always separable in the temporal frequency domain. This makes it possible to analyze transient transport one temporal frequency at a time by trivially adapting techniques from conventional projector-to-camera transport. We use this idea in a prototype that offers three never-seen-before abilities: (1) acquiring time-of-flight depth images that are robust to general indirect transport, such as interreflections and caustics; (2) distinguishing between direct views of objects and their mirror reflection; and (3) using a photonic mixer device to capture sharp, evolving wavefronts of \"light-in-flight\".

Existing methods that use mesh-based schemes are able to achieve injectivity and/or control distortion, but fail to create smooth mappings, unless they use a prohibitively large number of elements, which slows them down. Meshless methods are usually smooth by construction, yet they are not able to avoid fold-overs and/or control distortion. Our approach constrains the linear deformation spaces induced by popular smooth basis functions, such as B-Splines, Gaussian and Thin-Plate Splines, at a set of collocation points, using specially tailored convex constraints that prevent fold-overs and high distortion at these points. Our analysis then provides the required density of collocation points and/or constraint type, which guarantees that the map is injective and meets the distortion constraints over the entire domain of interest.

In the current system, multiple particles are levitated together at 4.25-mm intervals. The spatial resolution of the position is 0.5 mm. Particles move at up to 72 cm/s. The allowable density of the material can be up to 7 g/cm3. For this study, we use three options of APF: 2D grid, high-speed movement, and combination with motion capture. These are used to realize floating screen or mid-air raster graphics, mid-air vector graphics, and interaction with levitated objects. This paper reports the details of the acoustic-potential field generator on the design, control, performance evaluation, and exploration of the application space. To discuss the various noncontact manipulation technologies in a unified manner, we introduce a concept called \"computational potential field\" (CPF). ",

A simple interface allows novice users to choose template parts from the database, change their parameters, and combine them to create new models. Using the information in the template database, the system can automatically position, align, and connect parts: the system accomplishes this by adjusting parameters, adding appropriate constraints, and assigning connectors. This process ensures that the created models can be fabricated, saves the user from many tedious but necessary tasks, and makes it possible for non-experts to design and create actual physical objects.

Case (a): New faces can either be inserted for all edges (left) or not at all by adjusting adjacent faces (middle). In addition, our solution can adaptively add new faces where needed (right). New faces are blue and modified adjacent faces are green. In (b-d), the left figure is the input, the middle is the degenerate result by previous approaches, and the right is our result. Non-planar or self-intersecting faces are red and edge collapses are blue dots. Abstract PushPull tools are implemented in most commercial 3D modeling suites. Their purpose is to intuitively transform a face, edge, or vertex, and then to adapt the polygonal mesh locally. However, previous approaches have limitations: Some allow adjustments only when adjacent faces are orthogonal; others support slanted surfaces but never create new details. Moreover, self-intersections and edge-collapses during editing are either ignored or work only partially for solid geometry. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the PushPull++ tool for rapid polygonal modeling. In our solution, we contribute novel methods for adaptive face insertion, adjacent face updates, edge collapse handling, and an intuitive user interface that automatically proposes useful drag directions. We show that PushPull++ reduces the complexity of common modeling tasks by up to an order of magnitude when compared with existing tools.",

However, for other applications, such as quadrangulation, remeshing, and planar deformations, global bijectively may be unnecessarily constraining and requires significant increase on map distortion. For that reason, our algorithm allows the fixed boundary to intersect itself, and is guaranteed to produce a map that is injective locally (if such a map exists). We also extend the basic ideas of the algorithm to support the computation of discrete approximation for extremal quasiconformal maps. The algorithm is conceptually simple and fast.

So far, a significant drawback in this class of techniques is that the choice of cuts introduces a bias in the computation of the map that often causes visible artifacts and wrong correspondences. In this paper we develop a surface mapping technique that is indifferent to the particular cut choice. This is achieved by a novel type of surface flattenings that encodes this cut-invariance, and when optimized with a suitable energy functional results in a seamless surface-to-surface map. We show the algorithm enables producing high-quality seamless bijective maps for pairs of surfaces with a wide range of shape variability and from a small number of prescribed correspondences.

We show that the texturedness assumption allows reflectance capture using only two images of a planar sample, taken with and without a headlight flash. Our reconstruction pipeline starts with redistributing reflectance observations across the image, followed by a regularized texture statistics transfer and a nonlinear optimization to fit a spatially-varying BRDF (SVBRDF) to the resulting data.

In this paper, we introduce a stream function approach to liquid simulations with novel boundary conditions for free surfaces, solid obstacles, and solid-fluid coupling. Although our approach increases the dimension of the linear system necessary to enforce incompressibility, it provides interesting and surprising benefits. First, the resulting flow is guaranteed to be divergence-free regardless of the accuracy of the solve. Second, our free-surface boundary conditions guarantee divergence-free motion even in the un-simulated air phase, which enables two-phase flow simulation by only computing a single phase.

Given a working linkage as input, the user can make targeted edits to the shape or motion of selected parts while preserving other, e.g., functionally-important aspects. In order to make this process intuitive and efficient, we provide a number of editing tools at different levels of abstraction. For instance, the user can directly change the structure of a linkage by displacing joints, edit the motion of selected points on the linkage, or impose limits on the size of its enclosure. Our method safeguards against degenerate configurations during these edits, thus ensuring the correct functioning of the mechanism at all times. Linkage editing poses strict requirements on performance that standard approaches fail to provide. In order to enable interactive and robust editing, we build on a symbolic kinematics approach that uses closed-form expressions instead of numerical methods to compute the motion of a linkage and its derivatives. We demonstrate our system on a diverse set of examples, illustrating the potential to adapt and personalize the structure and motion of existing linkages. To validate the feasibility of our edited designs, we fabricated two physical prototypes.  home. While there is interest and value in replication, however, this usage forgoes the true potential of 3D printers: personalization--the opportunity to adapt content to individual needs and preferences. A variety of existing software tools allow for intuitive editing of static digital models. Some of these tools even maintain or establish structural stability by virtue of finite element analysis.

In this work we present the first method for detailed spatio-temporal reconstruction of eyelids. Tracking and reconstructing eyelids is extremely challenging, as this region exhibits very complex and unique skin deformation where skin is folded under while opening the eye. Furthermore, eyelids are often only partially visible and obstructed due to self-occlusion and eyelashes. Our approach is to combine a geometric deformation model with image data, leveraging multi-view stereo, optical flow, contour tracking and wrinkle detection from local skin appearance. Our deformation model serves as a prior that enables reconstruction of eyelids even under strong self-occlusions caused by rolling and folding skin as the eye opens and closes. The output is a person-specific, time-varying eyelid reconstruction with anatomically plausible deformations.

This transform can effectively preserve and sharpen salient edges and contours while eliminating insignificant details, producing a nearly piecewise constant image with sparse structures. A variant of this image transform can perform edge-preserving smoothing more effectively than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. We further present a new method for complex scene-level intrinsic image decomposition. Our method relies on the above image transform to suppress surface shading variations, and perform probabilistic reflectance clustering on the flattened image instead of the original input image to achieve higher accuracy. Extensive testing on the Intrinsic-Images-in-the-Wild database indicates our method can perform significantly better than existing techniques both visually and numerically. The obtained intrinsic images have been successfully used in two applications, surface retexturing and 3D object compositing in photographs.",

The core idea is to enhance a global real-time face tracker, which provides a low-resolution face mesh, with local regressors that add in medium-scale details, such as expression wrinkles. Our main observation is that although wrinkles appear in different scales and at different locations on the face, they are locally very self-similar and their visual appearance is a direct consequence of their local shape. We therefore train local regressors from high-resolution capture data in order to predict the local geometry from local appearance at runtime. We propose an automatic way to detect and align the local patches required to train the regressors and run them efficiently in real-time. Our formulation is particularly designed to enhance the low-resolution global tracker with exactly the missing expression frequencies, avoiding superimposing spatial frequencies in the result. Our system is generic and can be applied to any real-time tracker that uses a global prior, e.g. blend-shapes. Once trained, our online capture approach can be applied to any new user without additional training, resulting in high-fidelity facial performance reconstruction with person-specific wrinkle details from a monocular video camera in real-time.",

We identify a set of primitive actions which account for the vast majority of motions observed in human dressing. These primitive actions can be assembled into a variety of motion sequences for dressing different garments with different styles. Exploiting both feed-forward and feedback control mechanisms, we develop a dressing controller to handle each of the primitive actions. The controller plans a path to achieve the action goal while making constant adjustments locally based on the current state of the simulated cloth when necessary. We demonstrate that our framework is versatile and able to animate dressing with different clothing types including a jacket, a pair of shorts, a robe, and a vest. Our controller is also robust to different cloth mesh resolutions which can cause the cloth simulator to generate significantly different cloth motions.

We then propose an effective algorithm to remove these valid removal sheets in order. Finally, we present a structure-aware optimization strategy to improve the geometric quality of the resulting hex-mesh after fixing the misalignments.

Key to our method is a novel technique for decomposing a photograph of a scene in several images that encode how much of the observed radiance has interacted a specified number of times with the target diffuse surface. Altering the albedo of the target area is then simply a weighted sum of the decomposed components. We estimate the interaction components by recursively applying the light transport operator and formulate the resulting radiance in each recursion as a linear expression in terms of the relevant interaction components. Our method only requires a camera-projector pair, and the number of required measurements per scene is linearly proportional to the decomposition degree for a single target area. Our method does not impose restrictions on the lighting or on the material properties in the unaltered part of the scene. Furthermore, we extend our method to accommodate editing of the albedo in multiple target areas with consistent interreflections and we introduce a prediction model for reducing the acquisition cost.

Most of the approaches optimize a new image so that the color neighborhoods in the output closely match those in the input, across all scales. In this paper we revisit by-example texture synthesis in the context of additive manufacturing. Our goal is to generate not only colors, but also structure along output surfaces: given an exemplar indicating 'solid' and 'empty' pixels, we generate a similar pattern along the output surface. The core challenge is to guarantee that the pattern is not only fully connected, but also structurally sound. To achieve this goal we propose a novel formulation for on-surface by-example texture synthesis that directly works in a voxel shell around the surface. It enables efficient local updates to the pattern, letting our structural optimizer perform changes that improve the overall rigidity of the pattern. We use this technique in an iterative scheme that jointly optimizes for appearance and structural soundness.

Our method also achieves more evenly and smoothly distributed distortion (see the standard deviation of the isometric distortion 8iso dev). The color on triangles encodes the isometric distortion, with white being optimal. Abstract Computing locally injective mappings with low distortion in an efficient way is a fundamental task in computer graphics. By revisiting the well-known MIPS (Most-Isometric ParameterizationS) method, we introduce an advanced MIPS method that inherits the local injectivity of MIPS, achieves as low as possible distortions compared to the state-of-the-art locally injective mapping techniques, and performs one to two orders of magnitude faster in computing a mesh-based mapping. The success of our method relies on two key components. The first one is an enhanced MIPS energy function that penalizes the maximal distortion significantly and distributes the distortion evenly over the domain for both mesh-based and mesh-less mappings. The second is a use of the inexact block coordinate descent method in mesh-based mapping in a way that efficiently minimizes the distortion with the capability not to be trapped early by the local minimum.

In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new imaging modality for all time-of-flight (ToF) cameras: per-pixel radial velocity measurement. The proposed technique exploits the Doppler effect of objects in motion, which shifts the temporal illumination frequency before it reaches the camera. Using carefully coded illumination and modulation frequencies of the ToF camera, object velocities directly map to measured pixel intensities. We show that a slight modification of our imaging system allows for color, depth, and velocity information to be captured simultaneously.

In particular, advances of high-resolution micro displays, low-latency orientation trackers, and modern GPUs facilitate extremely immersive experiences. To facilitate comfortable long-term experiences and wide-spread user acceptance, however, the vergence-accommodation conflict inherent to all stereoscopic displays will have to be solved. We present the first factored near-eye display technology supporting high image resolution as well as focus cues: accommodation and retinal blur. To this end, we build on Wheatstone’s original stereoscope but augment it with modern factored light field synthesis via stacked liquid crystal panels. The proposed light field stereoscope is conceptually closely related to emerging factored light field displays, but it has very unique characteristics compared to the television-type displays explored thus far. Foremost, the required field of view is extremely small – just the size of the pupil – which allows for rank-1 factorizations to produce correct or nearly-correct focus cues. We analyze distortions of the lenses in the near-eye 4D light fields and correct them using the high-dimensional image formation afforded by our display. We demonstrate significant improvements in resolution and retinal blur quality over previously-proposed near-eye displays. Finally, we analyze diffraction limits of these types of displays along with fundamental resolution limits.",

Differently from previous works, we do not regard functionality as an abstract label or represent it implicitly through an agent. Our descriptor, called interaction context or ICON for short, explicitly represents the geometry of object-to-object interactions. Our approach to object functionality analysis is based on the key premise that functionality should mainly be derived from interactions between objects and not objects in isolation. Specifically, ICON collects geometric and structural features to encode interactions between a central object in a 3D scene and its surrounding objects. These interactions are then grouped based on feature similarity, leading to a hierarchical structure. By focusing on interactions and their organization, ICON is insensitive to the numbers of objects that appear in a scene, the specific disposition of objects around the central object, or the objects' fine-grained geometry. With a series of experiments, we demonstrate the potential of ICON in functionality-oriented shape processing, including shape retrieval (either directly or by complementing existing shape descriptors), segmentation, and synthesis.

This approach can be differentiated from existing relevant methods because such methods represent surfaces by a triangulated mesh surface or a network consisting of lines. The proposed method is based on the theory of Airy stress functions. Although some existing methods are also based on this theory, they apply its discrete version to discrete geometries. The proposed method simultaneously applies the theory to parametric surfaces directly and the discrete theory to the edges of parametric patches. The discontinuous boundary between continuous patches naturally corresponds to ribs seen in traditional vault masonry buildings. We use nonuniform rational B-spline surfaces in this study; however, the basic idea can be applied to other parametric surfaces.

This enables the users to add (or remove) control handles very quickly, allowing them to realize their creative intent in a single interactive session. Abstract We propose a method to design linear deformation subspaces, unifying linear blend skinning and generalized barycentric coordinates. Deformation subspaces cut down the time complexity of variational shape deformation methods and physics-based animation (reduced-order physics). Our subspaces feature many desirable properties: interpolation, smoothness, shape-awareness, locality, and both constant and linear precision. We achieve these by minimizing a quadratic deformation energy, built via a discrete Laplacian inducing linear precision on the domain boundary. Our main advantage is speed: subspace bases are solutions to a sparse linear system, computed interactively even for generously tessellated domains. Users may seamlessly switch between applying transformations at handles and editing the subspace by adding, removing or relocating control handles. The combination of fast computation and good properties means that designing the right subspace is now just as creative as manipulating handles. This paradigm shift in handle-based deformation opens new opportunities to explore the space of shape deformations.",

As generic frame fields (with arbitrary anisotropy, orientation, and sizing) can be regarded as cross fields in a specific Riemannian metric, we tackle frame field design by first computing a discrete metric on the input surface that is compatible with a sparse or dense set of input constraints. The final frame field is then found by computing an optimal cross field in this customized metric. We propose frame field design constraints on alignment, size, and skewness at arbitrary locations on the mesh as well as along feature curves, offering much improved flexibility over previous approaches.

In these methods, particles are used to resolve transport and topological change, while a background Eulerian grid is used for computing mechanical forces and collision responses.

While these approaches have proven very powerful, they do suffer from some well known limitations. The original PIC is stable, but highly dissipative, while FLIP, designed to remove this dissipation, is more noisy and at times, unstable. We present a novel technique designed to retain the stability of the original PIC, without suffering from the noise and instability of FLIP. Our primary observation is that the dissipation in the original PIC results from a loss of information when transferring between grid and particle representations. We prevent this loss of information by augmenting each particle with a locally affine, rather than locally constant, description of the velocity. We show that this not only stably removes the dissipation of PIC, but that it also allows for exact conservation of angular momentum across the transfers between particles and grid.",

By allowing small violations of the target skip rate we create hyperlapse videos that are smooth even when there is significant camera motion (pink lines). Optimizing an energy function (color-coded in Middle image) that balances matching the target rate while minimizing frame-to-frame motion results in a set offrames that are then stabilized. (Right) To illustrate the alignment we show the mean and standard deviation of three successive frames (in red box on the Left plot) after stabilization for the naive hyperlapse (Top Right) and our result (Bottom Right)  these show that our selected frames align much better than those from naive selection. Abstract Long videos can be played much faster than real-time by recording only one frame per second or by dropping all but one frame each second, i.e., by creating a timelapse. Unstable hand-held moving videos can be stabilized with a number of recently described methods. Unfortunately, creating a stabilized timelapse, or hyperlapse, cannot be achieved through a simple combination of these two methods. Two hyperlapse methods have been previously demonstrated: one with high computational complexity and one requiring special sensors. We present an algorithm for creating hyperlapse videos that can handle significant high-frequency camera motion and runs in real-time on HD video. Our approach does not require sensor data, thus can be run on videos captured on any camera. We optimally select frames from the input video that best match a desired target speed-up while also resulting in the smoothest possible camera motion. We evaluate our approach using several input videos from a range of cameras and compare these results to existing methods.",

In this paper, we observe there is a complex relationship between the noisy scene data and the ideal filter parameters, and propose to learn this relationship using a nonlinear regression model. To do this, we use a multilayer perceptron neural network and combine it with a matching filter during both training and testing. To use our framework, we first train it in an offline process on a set of noisy images of scenes with a variety of distributed effects. Then at run-time, the trained network can be used to drive the filter parameters for new scenes to produce filtered images that approximate the ground truth. We demonstrate that our trained network can generate filtered images in only a few seconds that are superior to previous approaches on a wide range of distributed effects such as depth of field, motion blur, area lighting, glossy reflections, and global illumination.

Instead of trying to improve the explicit 3D scene representation, the key idea of our method is to exploit the high redundancy of approximate scene information that arises due to most scene points being visible multiple times across many frames of video.

Abstract This paper presents a method for learning to predict the stylistic compatibility between 3D furniture models from different object classes: e.g., how well does this chair go with that table? To do this, we collect relative assessments of style compatibility using crowdsourcing. We then compute geometric features for each 3D model and learn a mapping of them into a space where Euclidean distances represent style incompatibility. Motivated by the geometric subtleties of style, we introduce part-aware geometric feature vectors that characterize the shapes of different parts of an object separately. Motivated by the need to compute style compatibility between different object classes, we introduce a method to learn object class-specific mappings from geometric features to a shared feature space. During experiments with these methods, we find that they are effective at predicting style compatibility agreed upon by people. We find in user studies that the learned compatibility metric is useful for novel interactive tools that: 1) retrieve stylistically compatible models for a query, 2) suggest a piece of furniture for an existing scene, and 3) help guide an interactive 3D modeler towards scenes with compatible furniture.",

Namely, given a 3D object representing a piece of furniture, our goal is to apply a minimum amount of modification to the object so that it can be folded to save space -- the object is thus foldabilized. We focus on one instance of the problem where folding is with respect to a prescribed folding direction and allowed object modifications include hinge insertion and part shrinking. We develop an automatic algorithm for foldabilization by formulating and solving a nested optimization problem operating at two granularity levels of the input shape. Specifically, the input shape is first partitioned into a set of integral folding units. For each unit, we construct a graph which encodes conflict relations, e.g., collisions, between foldings implied by various patch foldabilizations within the unit. Finding a minimum-cost foldabilization with a conflictfree folding is an instance of the maximum-weight independent set problem. In the outer loop of the optimization, we process the folding units in an optimized ordering where the units are sorted based on estimated foldabilization costs.

Yet, existing camera manipulation tools only provide limited interaction methods and automated techniques remain computationally expensive.

Abstract There are currently no solutions for enabling direct face-to-face interaction between virtual reality (VR) users wearing head-mounted displays (HMDs). The main challenge is that the headset obstructs a significant portion of a users face, preventing effective facial capture with traditional techniques. To advance virtual reality as a next-generation communication platform, we develop a novel HMD that enables 3D facial performance-driven animation in real-time. Our wearable system uses ultra-thin flexible electronic materials that are mounted on the foam liner of the headset to measure surface strain signals corresponding to upper face expressions. These strain signals are combined with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to enhance the tracking in the mouth region and to account for inaccurate HMD placement. To map the input signals to a 3D face model, we perform a single-instance offline training session for each person. For reusable and accurate online operation, we propose a short calibration step to readjust the Gaussian mixture distribution of the mapping before each use. The resulting animations are visually on par with cutting-edge depth sensor-driven facial performance capture systems and hence, are suitable for social interactions in virtual worlds.",

While a range of methods exist for discretizing 3D objects with an initial topologically suitable hex mesh, their output meshes frequently contain poorly shaped and even inverted elements, requiring a further quality optimization step. We introduce a novel framework for optimizing hex-mesh quality capable of generating inversion-free high-quality meshes from such poor initial inputs. We recast hex quality improvement as an optimization of the shape of overlapping cones, or unions, of tetrahedra surrounding every directed edge in the hex mesh, and show the two to be equivalent. We then formulate cone shape optimization as a sequence of convex quadratic optimization problems, where hex convexity is encoded via simple linear inequality constraints. As this solution space may be empty, we therefore present an alternate formulation which allows the solver to proceed even when constraints cannot be satisfied exactly. We iteratively improve mesh element quality by solving at each step a set of local, per-cone, convex constrained optimization problems, followed by a global energy minimization step which reconciles these local solutions. This latter method provides no theoretical guarantees on the solution but produces inversion-free, high quality meshes in practice. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework by optimizing numerous poor quality input meshes generated using a variety of initial meshing methods and producing high-quality inversion-free meshes in each case. We further validate our algorithm by comparing it against previous work, and demonstrate a significant improvement in both worst and average element quality.",

In contrast, we introduce the first structure-transcending style similarity measure and validate it to be well aligned with human perception of stylistic similarity. Our measure is inspired by observations about style similarity in art history literature, which point to the presence of similarly shaped, salient, geometric elements as one of the key indicators of stylistic similarity. We translate these observations into an algorithmic measure by first quantifying the geometric properties that make humans perceive geometric elements as similarly shaped and salient in the context of style, then employing this quantification to detect pairs of matching style related elements on the analyzed models, and finally collating the element-level geometric similarity measurements into an object-level style measure consistent with human perception. To achieve this consistency we employ crowdsourcing to quantify the different components of our measure; we learn the relative perceptual importance of a range of elementary shape distances and other parameters used in our measurement from 50K responses to cross-structure style similarity queries provided by over 2500 participants.We train and validate our method on this dataset, showing it to successfully predict relative style similarity with near 90% accuracy based on 10-fold cross-validation.",

These materials pose a particular challenge as the complex scattering properties of individual grains, and their packing arrangement, can have a dramatic effect on the large-scale appearance of the aggregate object. We propose a multi-scale modeling and rendering framework that adapts to the structure of scattered light at different scales. We rely on path tracing the individual grains only at the finest scale, and—by decoupling individual grains from their arrangement—we develop a modular approach for simulating longer-scale light transport. We model light interactions within and across grains as separate processes and leverage this decomposition to derive parameters for classical radiative transport, including standard volumetric path tracing and a diffusion method that can quickly summarize the large scale transport due to many grain interactions. We require only a one-time precomputation per exemplar grain, which we can then reuse for arbitrary aggregate shapes and a continuum of different packing rates and scales of grains. We demonstrate our method on scenes containing mixtures of tens of millions of individual, complex, specular grains that would be otherwise infeasible to render with standard techniques.",

Getting it right requires constant iteration, performed either manually or driven by an automated system. Unfortunately, Previous algorithms for accelerating three-dimensional finite element analysis of elastic objects suffer from expensive pre-computation stages that rely on a priori knowledge of the objects geometry and material composition. In this paper we introduce Data-Driven Finite Elements as a solution to this problem. Given a material palette, our method constructs a metamaterial library which is reusable for subsequent simulations, regardless of object geometry and/or material composition. At runtime, we perform fast coarsening of a simulation mesh using a simple table lookup to select the appropriate metamaterial model for the coarsened elements. When the objects material distribution or geometry changes, we do not need to update the metamaterial librarywe simply need to update the metamaterial assignments to the coarsened elements. An important advantage of our approach is that it is applicable to non-linear material models. This is important for designing objects that undergo finite deformation (such as those produced by multimaterial 3D printing). Our method yields speed gains of up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining good accuracy.

For appearance information, we use histograms of image intensities and steerable coefficients. We formulate the volume modeling as an energy minimization problem with statistical hard constraints, which is solved using an expectation maximization (EM)-like iterative algorithm. Our algorithm begins with a rough estimate of the initial volume modeled from the input images, followed by an iterative process whereby we first render the images of the current volume with novel viewing angles. Then, we modify the rendered images by transferring the appearance information from the input images, and we thereafter model the improved volume based on the modified images. We iterate these operations until the volume converges.

Abstract We present a neural network regression method for relighting real-world scenes from a small number of images. The relighting in this work is formulated as the product of the scenes light transport matrix and new lighting vectors, with the light transport matrix reconstructed from the input images. Based on the observation that there should exist non-linear local coherence in the light transport matrix, our method approximates matrix segments using neural networks that model light transport as a non-linear function of light source position and pixel coordinates. Central to this approach is a proposed neural network design which incorporates various elements that facilitate modeling of light transport from a small image set. In contrast to most image based relighting techniques, this regression-based approach allows input images to be captured under arbitrary illumination conditions, including light sources moved freely by hand. We validate our method with light transport data of real scenes containing complex lighting effects, and demonstrate that fewer input images are required in comparison to related techniques.",

(a) With CGA++, modeling decisions can be coordinated across multiple shapes, e.g., to guarantee that overall exactly one door is created. (b) CGA++ enables operations involving multiple shapes, such as Boolean operations. Hence, masses can be merged to avoid overlapping geometries, allowing, e.g., one roof covering the whole building. (c) Generic contextual information can be obtained and acted on in CGA++, whereas previous solutions at best support a narrow set of context sensitivity. While they only allow canceling windows partially occluded, CGA++ additionally enables consistently adjusting all top floor windows. (d) Traditionally, only one alternative can be pursued during one specific derivation. CGA++, however, makes it possible to investigate multiple ones and choose the best of them. On a corner lot, the building grammar may fail if it executes only one option stochastically, and the selected one causes the garage to end up on an irregular footprint. CGA++ allows all options to be explored, robustly evading such failure cases. Abstract We present the novel grammar language CGA++ for the procedural modeling of architecture. While existing grammar-based approaches can produce stunning results, they are limited in what modeling scenarios can be realized. In particular, many context-sensitive tasks are precluded, not least because within the rules specifying how one shape is refined, the necessary knowledge about other shapes is not available. Transcending such limitations, CGA++ significantly raises the expressiveness and offers a generic and integrated solution for many advanced procedural modeling problems. Pivotally, CGA++ grants first-class citizenship to shapes, enabling, within a grammar, directly accessing shapes and shape trees, operations on multiple shapes, rewriting shape (sub)trees, and spawning new trees (e.g., to explore multiple alternatives). The new linguistic device of events allows coordination across multiple shapes, featuring powerful dynamic grouping and synchronization.

We achieve this using a method we call subspace condensation, a variant on the classic static condensation precomputation. However, instead of a precomputation, we use the speed of subspace methods to perform the condensation at every frame. This approach allows the full space regions to be specified arbitrarily at runtime, and forms a natural two-way coupling with the subspace regions. While condensation is usually only applicable to linear materials, the speed of our technique enables its application to nonlinear materials as well.

We show that geometric stiffness, the tensor encoding the change of force directions (as opposed to intensities) in response to a change of positions, is the missing piece between the two approaches. This previously neglected stiffness term is easy to implement and dramatically improves the stability of inextensible objects and articulated chains, without adding artificial bending forces.

Instead of taking smaller time steps or using significantly more complex time integration, we propose a new scheme called IVOCK (Integrated Vorticity of Convective Kinematics) which cheaply captures much of what is lost in self-advection by identifying it as a violation of the vorticity equation. We measure vorticity on the grid before and after advection, taking into account vortex stretching, and use a cheap multigrid V-cycle approximation to a vector potential whose curl will correct the vorticity error.

        "abstract": "In this work we detail the first algorithm that provides topological control during surface reconstruction from an input set of planar cross-sections. Our work has broad application in a number of fields including surface modeling and biomedical image analysis, where surfaces of known topology must be recovered. Given curves on arbitrarily oriented cross-sections, our method produces a manifold interpolating surface that exactly matches a user-specified genus. The key insight behind our approach is to formulate the topological search as a divide-and-conquer optimization process which scores local sets of topologies and combines them to satisfy the global topology constraint. We further extend our method to allow image data to guide the topological search, achieving even better results than relying on the curves alone. By simultaneously satisfying both geometric and topological constraints, we are able to produce accurate reconstructions with fewer input cross-sections, hence reducing the manual time needed to extract the desired shape.",
